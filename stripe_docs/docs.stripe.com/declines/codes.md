# Decline codes

A decline code is typically a two-digit, alphanumeric error code that indicates a reason for the decline. While the code can originate from a number of sources, it often comes from the issuing bank, payment processor, or credit network.

## Stripe decline codes

Stripe uses its own decline codes, which cover many of the same potential reasons as the traditional decline codes, but define the problem more clearly. Use the following table to help resolve issues relating to decline codes:
