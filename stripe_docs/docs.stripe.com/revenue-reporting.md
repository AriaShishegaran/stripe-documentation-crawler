## Performance insight charts

View the following charts to gain insight on your business performance.

Define segments and filters to refine your data.

Metrics detail page

Select one of the following categories under Group by to segment metrics:

- Product

- Price

- Country

- State

- Metadata on a customer, subscription, product, charge, invoice, and invoice item

You can’t use Group by for charts that contain a default segmentation (for example, net revenue is grouped by fees, refunds, and disputes). Instead, click one of the categories under Filter to generate specific segments in these charts.

Click Group by product to view gross revenue data, then filter by Country to view how much revenue is generated for each product by the country or countries you selected.

Use the following tabs to further refine your data:

- Summary: The cumulative revenue or count for the time period you select.

- Data: Shows individual transactions that make up the summary. Download this data to CSV to conduct audits for a high volume of transactions.

- Methodology: Shows how we calculate the numbers that you see in the charts.

Download reports as CSV files with any configuration:
