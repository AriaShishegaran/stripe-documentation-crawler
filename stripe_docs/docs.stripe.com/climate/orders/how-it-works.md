# How it works

Climate Orders enables companies to buy permanent carbon removal from the Frontier offtake portfolio and its individual suppliers. When you purchase carbon removal, your company can help contribute to the world’s net zero carbon goals and help fund emerging carbon removal technologies.

To help you incorporate carbon removal into your climate offering, Frontier does the following for you:

- Procures supply: This requires establishing purchasing criteria, sourcing promising projects, and negotiating contracts.

- Monitors supplier progress: This includes monitoring supplier performance against key milestones.

- Manages deliveries: This includes validating delivery and retiring purchases.

## Procure supply

Frontier’s in-house team of experts and a group of 60+ technical reviewers source and vet all suppliers. We look for permanent carbon removal solutions that have the potential to be low-cost and high-volume in the future, even if they aren’t today.

We use these factors to make purchasing decisions:

Specifically, Frontier focuses on technologies that meet the following criteria:

We conduct diligence and sign long-term offtake agreements with the most promising suppliers that meet our criteria so that you don’t have to. Early offtakes are a unique way to buy carbon removal because they help projects start building today so that they can deliver tons in the near future.

## Monitor supplier progress

Because the carbon removal industry is in its early stages, it’s likely that some suppliers will be delayed or fail. Apart from conducting careful diligence, Frontier minimizes delivery delays and failures by actively monitoring progress against supplier-specific milestones, reallocating offtake agreements across suppliers as needed, and maintaining an inventory buffer.

If an order is delayed or fails, we’ll send you an email and the relevant webhook at least 60 days in advance.

- Delays. You’ll have the option of receiving a full refund or waiting for the tons to be delivered.

- Individual supplier failures. We’ll try to substitute your order with another similar supplier in the Frontier portfolio. Substituted carbon removal units might vary by pathway, geography, and price. If you don’t want a substitute, you can cancel the order and receive a full refund.

## Manage deliveries

When Frontier receives the verified carbon removal from the supplier, the carbon removal units are retired on an independent third party registry. All deliveries are third party verified.

At the time of delivery, Frontier shares a delivery certificate and important details about the suppliers that fulfilled your order.

When possible, Frontier retires the carbon removal units on your behalf (or on behalf of your beneficiary). If we can’t name the buyer on the third party registry, we’ll retire orders in Frontier’s name.

After delivery of your order, you can use your carbon removal units for net zero¹ or carbon neutrality claims.² You can’t make these claims prior to delivery.

## Get started

You can purchase carbon removal programmatically using the Climate API or manually using the Dashboard.

¹ The Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) has become the de facto standard for companies setting net zero targets. SBTi requires that, to make a net zero claim, companies must (i) plan to reduce their current emissions by at least 90% relative to current levels, (ii) purchase permanent carbon removal—such as that being sold through the Climate API—on behalf of the remaining 10% of emissions, and (iii) support beyond value chain mitigation—a somewhat unclear concept that’s meant to capture all the various ways that companies can contribute to mitigating climate change or reducing its impacts outside of reducing their own emissions (or neutralizing them through permanent carbon removal purchases).

² Carbon neutrality is somewhat poorly defined, but is generally claimed when a company purchases an amount of carbon credits (or carbon removal units) equal to their remaining emissions.
