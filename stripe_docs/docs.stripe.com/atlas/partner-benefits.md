Stripe Atlas provides additional benefits to its users beyond helping them create a US company and obtain a US tax ID for the company. Stripe Atlas founders can activate a Stripe account, open a bank account with one of our banking partners, access free credits, and receive exclusive access to free products and discounted pricing from our partners (including up to 100,000 USD in credits).

Be aware that our partners might have specific rules and expiration dates for offers relevant to their program—check with each benefit partner for the terms of each benefit.

## Legal and bookkeeping

Stripe Atlas users have access to legal guides and free annotated legal templates that you can customize for your company’s next steps after incorporation. You can find these in your Dashboard. You also have access to a network of startup attorneys who can provide a short free consultation and flat-rate legal packages for Atlas users. You can contact us after forming your company to get in touch with our partner law firms.

## Additional perks

Atlas provides recommendations and partner discounts to help you choose the best tools for your business. After incorporating, you can see recommendations for handling your company’s finances and cap table, and operations and engineering functions (including AWS credits). Perks and eligibility vary by partner.

## Stripe Atlas Community

Stripe Atlas members join the Stripe Atlas community, a global community of entrepreneurs where members can connect with founders and get practical advice. You’ll get access to the community after you receive your company’s EIN. After we grant you access, use your Stripe account details to log in. If you have co-founders, you can grant them access to the Stripe Atlas Community by making them administrators of your Stripe account.
