# Using the standalone hosted onrampBeta

The standalone hosted onramp is a prebuilt frontend integration of the crypto onramp hosted at https://crypto.link.com. Platforms can integrate the crypto onramp by redirecting their users to the standalone hosted onramp, rather than hosting an embedded version of the onramp within their application.

Platforms that want to embed the crypto onramp within their application can integrate the onramp.

## Generate a redirect URL

Include the following scripts using script tags within the <head> element of your HTML. These scripts must always load directly from Stripe domains, https://js.stripe.com and https://crypto-js.stripe.com, for compatibility and PCI compliance. Donâ€™t include the scripts in a bundle or host a copy yourself. If you do, your integration might break without warning.

Generate a redirect URL using the Standalone function, passing in desired parameters:

We allow the following parameters to be pre-populated:

- source_currency: The fiat currency for the transaction (usd only for now).

- amount: The fixed amount of fiat currency or cryptocurrency for this purchase. Specify a fiat amount by passing in source_amount (for example, {source_amount: 42}). Specify a cryptocurrency amount by passing in destination_amount (for example, {destination_amount: 42}). You can only specify one amount.

- destination_currencies: An array of cryptocurrencies you want to restrict to (for example, [eth, usdc]).

- destination_networks: An array of crypto networks you want to restrict to (for example, [ethereum, polygon]).

- destination_network: The default crypto network for this onramp (for example, ethereum).

- destination_currency: The default cryptocurrency for this onramp session (for example, eth).

Redirect your users to the URL for a prebuilt frontend integration of the crypto onramp on the standalone hosted onramp.

## Mint a session with a redirect URL

Similar to other integrations, you need to implement a server endpoint to create a new onramp session for every user visit. The onramp session creation request returns a redirect_url. Redirect your users to the URL for a fully customized and branded crypto onramp on the standalone hosted onramp.

[create a new onramp session](/crypto/using-the-api)

Generate a crypto onramp session with a redirect_url by running the following curl command in your terminal:

[crypto onramp session](/crypto/using-the-api#api-reference)
