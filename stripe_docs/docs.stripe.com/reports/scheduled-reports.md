# Scheduled reports

If you frequently download the same report, you can schedule report downloads to occur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. To manage the schedules of reports on a financial reports page, click Scheduleâ€¦ and select the schedule (frequency), columns, and currency for each report. When a scheduled report is ready to be downloaded, you receive an email notification.

To stop running a scheduled report, set its schedule to None.
