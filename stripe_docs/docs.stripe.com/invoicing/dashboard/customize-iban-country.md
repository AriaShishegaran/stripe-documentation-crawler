# Customize the IBAN country

There are multiple ways you can collect payment for your invoice, one of which is Bank Transfer. With this payment method, customers pay the invoice by transferring funds to a bank account, at which point Stripe reconciles the funds. The invoice provides the bank account details, and an International Bank Account Number (IBAN).
