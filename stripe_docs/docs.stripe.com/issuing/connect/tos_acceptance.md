# Update the Issuing terms of service acceptance

Platforms must present the account representative with the business information on file for confirmation prior to submission to Stripe Issuing. Make sure that the account representatives update any information that’s no longer accurate:

- Business Information (including the Tax Identification Number if applicable)

- Name, date of birth, address, and SSN of account representative and beneficial owners

Present the account representative with a disclosure stating that Celtic Bank, a member of FDIC, issues the cards. Additionally, provide them with all relevant links to the Issuing program’s terms and disclosures (as detailed in the Required Agreements section of the Treasury and Issuing compliance guidelines). The representative must accept these terms to complete their application.
