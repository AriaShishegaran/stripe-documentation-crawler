# Issuing merchant categories

Every business that processes card payments is categorized using Merchant Category Codes (MCC). The category name is provided as a value for merchant_data.category on Authorization objects. Some businesses may not fit into a specific category, in which case theyâ€™re categorized as miscellaneous.
