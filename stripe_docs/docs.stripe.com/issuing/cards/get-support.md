# Get support for self-service cards

Because of the different logos displayed on the back of our Issuing cards, it can often be unclear who users should contact for support issues (for example Stripe, Visa, or their platform).

Below we’ve outlined who your point of contact should be with Issuing cards depending on your use case.

If you’ve been provisioned a card by an entity, reach out directly to them for support issues—Stripe can’t assist end users directly.

If you’re receiving questions from users of your provisioned cards, you can request support from Stripe. Make sure to inform your cardholders that they need to reach out to you for support issues.
