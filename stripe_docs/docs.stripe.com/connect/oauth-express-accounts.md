# Using OAuth with Express accountsDeprecated

OAuth isn’t available for new Connect platforms. For new accounts, use Accounts API with Express instead. Extensions shouldn’t use Express OAuth, as extensions can’t connect to existing Express accounts. If you need access to OAuth for Express accounts, please contact support.

## The OAuth connection flow

A user connects to your platform using the following OAuth connection flow:

- On a page on your site, you provide a link that redirects your user to Stripe, passing along your platform’s client_id.

[link](#integrating-oauth)

- On Stripe’s website, the user provides the necessary information for connecting to your platform.

[connecting](#connect-users)

- Stripe redirects the user to your site, along with an authorization code.

[redirects](#redirected)

- Your site then makes a request to Stripe’s OAuth token endpoint to complete the connection and fetch the user’s account ID.

[OAuth token endpoint](#token-request)

After these steps are complete, you can make API requests for the user with their account ID.

## Step 1: You provide the OAuth link

Use this guide to learn how to use code to create a connected account. If you’re not ready to integrate yet, you can start by creating a connected account through the dashboard.

[through the dashboard](/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts)

To start your integration, go to your platform settings and:

[platform settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings)

- Enable onboarding Express accounts with OAuth in the OAuth settings.

- Copy your client_id, a unique identifier for your platform that’s generated by Stripe.

- Set your redirect_uri, the URL that your user is redirected to after connecting their account. You must specify all redirect URLs in your platform settings. If you don’t include the redirect_uri parameter in your request, Stripe defaults to using the first address you’ve configured in your platform settings.

Stripe also provides a development client_id to help with testing.

[testing](/connect/testing#using-oauth)

With these two pieces of information in hand, you’re ready to create the OAuth link. We recommend showing a Connect button that sends users to our Express OAuth endpoint:

[Connect button](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/connect/Connect-with-Stripe-button.zip)

[https://connect.stripe.com/express/oauth/authorize?redirect_uri=](https://connect.stripe.com/express/oauth/authorize?redirect_uri=)

[https://connect.stripe.com/connect/default/oauth/test](https://connect.stripe.com/connect/default/oauth/test)

To prevent CSRF attacks, add the state parameter with the value set to a unique token. Stripe includes this state value in the redirect URL that sends the user back to your site. Then, confirm that this state parameter has the same value you originally provided.

Here’s how you can present the example URL, along with our Connect with Stripe button:

[Connect with Stripe button](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/connect/Connect-with-Stripe-button.zip)

[Connect with](https://connect.stripe.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=ca_FkyHCg7X8mlvCUdMDao4mMxagUfhIwXb&scope=read_write)

You can change the behavior of the Express onboarding flow by including additional URL parameters in your OAuth link. A complete list of available parameters is available in the OAuth reference.

[OAuth reference](/connect/oauth-reference)

You can specify whether Stripe presents an Express onboarding form for individuals or companies by setting the stripe_user[business_type] parameter to either individual or company.

Stripe collects the right information for each type of account. For example, to onboard a company:

[https://connect.stripe.com/express/oauth/authorize?redirect_uri=](https://connect.stripe.com/express/oauth/authorize?redirect_uri=)

[https://connect.stripe.com/connect/default/oauth/test](https://connect.stripe.com/connect/default/oauth/test)

You can prefill some form fields on the user’s Stripe application by including the relevant URL parameters in your OAuth link.

[URL parameters](/connect/oauth-reference)

This example prefills the user’s email address with stripe_user[email]:

[https://connect.stripe.com/express/oauth/authorize?redirect_uri=](https://connect.stripe.com/express/oauth/authorize?redirect_uri=)

[https://connect.stripe.com/connect/default/oauth/test](https://connect.stripe.com/connect/default/oauth/test)

[https://connect.stripe.com/connect/default/oauth/test](https://connect.stripe.com/connect/default/oauth/test)

You can change the capabilities for new connected accounts in the Dashboard settings for Express. However, if you want to request different capabilities for each of your connected accounts, you can include the suggested_capabilities[] parameter in your OAuth link and override the Dashboard settings on the Express Configuration page.

[Dashboard settings for Express](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/express)

An example with the transfers capability:

[https://connect.stripe.com/express/oauth/authorize?redirect_uri=](https://connect.stripe.com/express/oauth/authorize?redirect_uri=)

[https://connect.stripe.com/connect/default/oauth/test](https://connect.stripe.com/connect/default/oauth/test)

Stripe adds the suggested capability to this Express account, unless one of the following conditions is met:

- If the user is in a country that doesn’t support transfers, Stripe attempts to designate the account as card_payments.

- If the user’s account doesn’t support transfers or card_payments, Stripe marks the account as having no capabilities.

You can verify that Stripe added the suggested capability by using the assert_capabilities[] parameter. This step is optional.

## Step 2: The user creates their account

When the user clicks the link on your site, it takes them to Stripe’s website, which prompts them to provide contact and payout information.

[payout](/payouts)

To test the onboarding process, you can provide (000) 000-0000 as a phone number. Instead of sending you an SMS message or email, Stripe lets you complete verification with the code 000-000.

Express displays your branding in the onboarding flow and the Express Dashboard. You can provide your platform name, logo, and optional brand color in the Connect settings section of the Stripe Dashboard.

[Connect settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings)

## Step 3: Stripe redirects the user to your site

After the user completes the onboarding process, Stripe redirects them back to your site using the URL defined as your platform’s redirect_uri.

For successful connections, the redirect URL includes the following values:

- The state value, if provided.

- An authorization code. The authorization code is short-lived, and can be used only once, in the POST request described in the next step.

[https://connect.stripe.com/connect/default/oauth/test?code={AUTHORIZATION_CODE}](https://connect.stripe.com/connect/default/oauth/test?code={AUTHORIZATION_CODE})

## Step 4: You complete the Express account connection

Include the provided authorization code in a POST request to Stripe’s token endpoint to complete the connection and fetch the user’s account ID:

Stripe returns a response that includes the account ID (stripe_user_id) for the user:

Or, if there’s a problem, Stripe returns a detailed error message:

The user is now connected to your platform. The stripe_user_id is the Stripe account ID for the new account. Store this value in your database and use it to authenticate as the connected account by passing it into requests in the Stripe-Account header.

Store stripe_user_id, which is the account’s ID. Platforms need this value (beginning with acct_) to transfer funds, create charges, and perform requests on the user’s behalf.

If you provide the suggested_capabilities[] parameter, you can add the assert_capabilities[] parameter to verify that the connected account now has the suggested capabilities. For instance, you can check this if you’re concerned about URL security. This step is optional, however. Stripe handles any failure to apply a capability silently.

A success response then looks like this:

If the specified capabilities[] value doesn’t match, the error response looks like this:

The most common reason for this request failure is that the specified capability isn’t available in your user’s country. A less likely reason is a bad actor changing the URL.

## Webhooks

After you create an account, you can get all account change notifications delivered to your webhooks as account.updated events. You set your Connect webhook URL in your account settings. These events let you track the onboarding and verification status of connected accounts, which you can use to provide user support and display notices in your platform’s user interface. Alternatively, you can let Stripe take your users through the steps of the onboarding and verification process and handle any issues that arise.

[webhooks](/connect/webhooks)

[webhook](/webhooks)

[account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks)

If you created an account in test mode using either a test mode API key or client_id, Stripe doesn’t send any emails while you build your Stripe integration. (But when you’re live, we do.)
