# View all accounts

The accounts overview page provides multiple ways to view your connected accounts. By default, the All accounts tab is selected. However, the other tabs organize accounts according to their status. Each tab includes the number of accounts with that status. When you select a tab, the results in your accounts list update automatically. You can then narrow these results further by using the filter feature on each tab.

## Status tabs and workflows

Selecting different status tabs on the account overview page automatically updates the filters and columns displayed. The interactive table below provides an overview and description of the columns associated with each tab. You can sort many of the columns listed below can also by clicking on the column heading in the Dashboard.

This tab is displayed by default, and is commonly used to see a high-level view of all your connected accounts.
