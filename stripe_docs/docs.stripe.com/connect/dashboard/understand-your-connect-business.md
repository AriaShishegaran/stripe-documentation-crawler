Use the Connect overview page in your Dashboard to understand and manage your Connect payments business. It includes three modules:

- Business insights

[Business insights](#business-insights)

- Tasks

[Tasks](#tasks)

- Resources

[Resources](#resources)

## Business insights

The main section of the page displays high-level metrics that you can use to better understand the health of your payments business, including:

A list of your five highest grossing accounts and their total lifetime gross amounts.

A snapshot of the current numbers of your connected accounts in Active, Restricted soon, and Restricted statuses.

## Tasks

The tasks section of the page displays cards representing platform tasks that you must complete. The tasks depend on the types of connected accounts that your platform supports. Each card links to a details page that explains how to complete that task.

If you have no open tasks to complete, you don’t see the Tasks section.

A task details page contains specific information required for you to complete the task. It can include actions, deadlines, and links to relevant resources.

A task can have one of the following statuses:

- Not started

- In progress

- Complete

When you complete a task, you can mark it complete by clicking Complete.

Here’s an example of the details page for the Modify your onboarding task:

## Resources

The Resources section of the overview page contains cards representing additional Connect resources. Each card links to a Stripe resource where you can learn more about a particular topic.
