# 1099 Tax Support proposed communication guidelines

## For platforms using e-delivery with Stripe Express to issue tax forms

We recommend sending a reminder (example below) to connected accounts once they’ve received their pre-filing confirmation from Stripe. Preparing your connected accounts for outreach from Stripe helps to make a smoother user experience during tax season. We’ll send you a heads up email once we start sending pre-filing confirmation emails to your connected accounts.

[Platform_Name] partners with Stripe to file 1099 tax forms that report your earnings or sales activity. You should have received an email from Stripe (express@stripe.com) with instructions about how to confirm your tax information and delivery preference to ensure your 1099 tax form is sent to the right place.

Please confirm your information using the link provided in the email from Stripe. You’ll need to create a Stripe Express account and confirm your information is up-to-date to receive your 1099 form for the 2023 tax year. You will be asked a series of security questions to verify your identity.

If you have any questions, visit https://support.stripe.com/express.

What is a 1099 form? A 1099-NEC/1099-MISC form summarizes your earnings as an independent contractor or service provider. It’s provided to you and the IRS, as well as some US states, if you earned $600 or more in 2023.

The 1099-K form summarizes the sales activity of your account. It will be provided to you and the IRS, as well as some US states, if you processed more than $20,000 and had more than 200 transactions in 2023.

Why do I need to verify my information? We want to ensure that information like your name, address, and Taxpayer Identification Number are up to date so that your 1099 tax form is accurate and sent to the right place.

I didn’t receive an email from Stripe—what should I do? Please double check your spam or junk mail folder for an email with the subject line “Get your [Platform_Name] 2023 tax forms faster by enabling e-delivery.” If you haven’t received this email from Stripe, please reach out to [Platform email].

When and where can I expect my 1099 tax form? 1099 tax forms are typically finalized in January. If you meet the income thresholds above, Stripe will send you a link to access your 1099 tax form (or mail a paper form if you prefer).
