After you integrate with dynamic payment methods, you can embed the payment methods settings component into your website to allow your users to manage their payment methods without the need to access the Stripe Dashboard.

The component uses the Payment Method Configurations and Account Capabilities APIs to capture your connected accountsâ€™ payment method setting preferences. The component is a low-code, customizable alternative to building a custom payment method settings UI for your connected accounts.

## Have your connected accounts enable payment methods

Your connected accounts can use the component to enable payment methods and provide compliance information without the need to access the Stripe Dashboard. If a connected account needs to provide additional compliance information to use a payment method, the component prompts them for the information and collects it up-front.

The embedded payment method settings component is currently available for connected accounts in the US that you (the platform) collect updated information from when requirements change. This includes Custom connected accounts.
