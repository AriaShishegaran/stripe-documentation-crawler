By adding a few lines of code to your Connect integration, you can:

[Connect](/connect)

- Request an ID document check during initial onboarding

- Match the ID photo with selfies of the document holder

- Disable payouts or payments based on verification status or volume thresholds

[payouts](/payouts)

- Access captured images and data extracted from ID documents

- Receive detailed status updates and error messages

Common use cases for additional verifications

- Reduce fraud losses—For example, platforms can streamline risk processes by inserting an ID verification before enabling the first payout.

- Increase trust & safety—For example, marketplaces facilitating in-person services can insert ID verification before allowing connected accounts to collect payments or interact with other users and can display a “verified” badge on their profile.

- Meet additional compliance requirements—For example, fintech platforms can conduct ID verification to confirm user identity as part of meeting their own KYC requirements.
