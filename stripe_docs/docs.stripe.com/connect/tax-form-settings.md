# Configure tax form settings

If you work for a platform that pays you via Stripe and want to learn about your 1099 forms and how to get them, see 1099 tax forms on the Stripe Support site.

Use the Stripe dashboard to configure the settings for the 1099 forms you send to connected accounts. You can change almost all tax settings for forms that you havenâ€™t filed. For example, if you initially set your tax form to report non-employee compensation (using 1099-NEC) and later determine you need to report payment transactions (using 1099-K), you can change the default form type and automatically update all forms.

If a user with the administrator role configured the tax form default settings in the onboarding flow for 1099 tax reporting, you can assign the Tax Analyst role to a team member on your account to allow that person full access to features in the Tax forms view.
