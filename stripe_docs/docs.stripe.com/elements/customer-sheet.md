# Integrate the Customer Sheet

This feature is currently in beta for Android.

The Customer Sheet is a prebuilt UI component that lets your customers manage their saved payment methods. It has a flexible architecture that supports advanced use cases and allows you to customize the underlying behavior. You can use the Customer Sheet UI outside of a checkout flow, and the appearance and styling is customizable to match the appearance and aesthetic of your app. Customers can add and remove payment methods, which get saved to the customer object, and set their default payment method stored locally on the device. Use both Mobile Payment Element and Customer Sheet to provide customers a consistent end-to-end solution for saved payment methods.
