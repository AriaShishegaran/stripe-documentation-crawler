Core webhooks notify you of account-level updates and newly created accounts. These include:

- financial_connections.account.created

- financial_connections.account.deactivated

- financial_connections.account.reactivated

Other webhooks notify you when Stripe completes asynchronous data refreshes for accounts that your customers have connected.
