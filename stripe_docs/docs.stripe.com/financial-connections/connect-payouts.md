- Increase onboarding conversion by eliminating the need for your connected accounts to leave your website or application to locate their account and routing numbers.

- Reduce payout failure rates by eliminating errors that result from manual entry of account and routing numbers.

- Make sure you donâ€™t need to store sensitive data such as account and routing numbers on your server.

- Save development time by eliminating your need to build bank account manual entry forms.

- Enable your users to connect their accounts in fewer steps with Link, allowing them to save and quickly reuse their bank account details across Stripe merchants.

Optionally, Stripe platforms in the US can request permission from your Custom account to retrieve additional data on their Financial Connections account. Consider accessing balances, transactions, and ownership information to optimize your onboarding process.

Retrieving additional account data can help you:

- Mitigate fraud when onboarding accounts by verifying the ownership details of their bank account, such as the name and address of the account holder.

- Underwrite accounts for financial services that you might offer on your platform with balances and transactions data.

## Get started
