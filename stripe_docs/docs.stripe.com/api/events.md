# Events

[Events](/api/events)

Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new Event object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a charge.succeeded event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an invoice.payment_failed event. Certain API requests might create multiple events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, you receive both a customer.subscription.created event and a charge.succeeded event.

Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event’s data field embeds the resource’s state at the time of the change. For example, a charge.succeeded event contains a charge, and an invoice.payment_failed event contains an invoice.

As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an individual event or a list of events from the API. We also have a separate webhooks system for sending the Event objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage webhooks in your account settings. Learn how to listen for events so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.

When using Connect, you can also receive event notifications that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there’s an additional account attribute in the received Event object.

[Connect](/connect)

We only guarantee access to events through the Retrieve Event API for 30 days.

# Retrieve an event

[Retrieve an event](/api/events/retrieve)

Retrieves the details of an event. Supply the unique identifier of the event, which you might have received in a webhook.

No parameters.

Returns an event object if a valid identifier was provided. All events share a common structure, detailed to the right. The only property that will differ is the data property.

In each case, the data dictionary will have an attribute called object and its value will be the same as retrieving the same object directly from the API. For example, a customer.created event will have the same information as retrieving the relevant customer would.

In cases where the attributes of an object have changed, data will also contain a dictionary containing the changes.

# List all events

[List all events](/api/events/list)

List events, going back up to 30 days. Each event data is rendered according to Stripe API version at its creation time, specified in event object api_version attribute (not according to your current Stripe API version or Stripe-Version header).

[event object](/api/events/object)

- typesarray of stringsAn array of up to 20 strings containing specific event names. The list will be filtered to include only events with a matching event property. You may pass either type or types, but not both.

An array of up to 20 strings containing specific event names. The list will be filtered to include only events with a matching event property. You may pass either type or types, but not both.

- createdobject

- delivery_successboolean

- ending_beforestring

- limitinteger

- starting_afterstring

- typestring

A dictionary with a data property that contains an array of up to limit events, starting after event starting_after. Each entry in the array is a separate event object. If no more events are available, the resulting array will be empty.

# Types of events

[Types of events](/api/events/types)

This is a list of all the types of events we currently send. We may add more at any time, so in developing and maintaining your code, you should not assume that only these types exist.

You’ll notice that these events follow a pattern: resource.event. Our goal is to design a consistent system that makes things easier to anticipate and code against. Events that occur on subresources like customer.subscription do not trigger the parent’s update event.

Events marked as Selection required are only created when a webhook has been configured to listen for that type of event specifically. A webhook set to listen to all events will not receive an event requiring explicit selection.
