# Products

[Products](/api/products)

Products describe the specific goods or services you offer to your customers. For example, you might offer a Standard and Premium version of your goods or service; each version would be a separate Product. They can be used in conjunction with Prices to configure pricing in Payment Links, Checkout, and Subscriptions.
