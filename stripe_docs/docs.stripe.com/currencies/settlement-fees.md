# Settling in additional currencies

The processing fees you pay depend on how you settle funds internationally.

## Settling in a different currency

When you settle funds to your Stripe account in a currency other than the primary currency of your Stripe account country, Stripe applies processing fees in that currency. Use the table below to see the acquiring fees for card usage in each currency.

## Payouts in a different currency

Any payouts from your Stripe account in a currency other than the primary currency of the country of the recipient bank account incur a fee. Certain payouts to non-domestic bank accounts also incur a fee. For more information on payout fees, see our payout docs.
