# Project timeline

A Stripe payments integration lets you accept payments, receive payouts, and reconcile your accounts. Use Stripe Elements to create a customized checkout flow with prebuilt UI components. Alternatively, use Checkout to build a payment form and embed it on your site or host it on Stripe.

Stripe’s APIs enable secure processing of payments across various global payment methods and currencies. Our APIs and the Dashboard centralize reporting, providing real-time data on charges, fees, refunds, and transfers. Get started by logging in or registering for a Stripe account.

## Get started

While you can integrate payments in as little as 1 week, the following timeline assumes that your business has internal systems that add complexity to your Stripe integration. With this in mind, we estimate that the total integration time can range from less than 1 week to up to 3 months. Primary dependencies include engineering resources, internal system integrations, and change management across impacted teams.
