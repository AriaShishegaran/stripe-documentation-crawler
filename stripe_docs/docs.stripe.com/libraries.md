# Stripe SDKs

## Server-side SDKs

Stripe’s server-side helper libraries (also known as server-side SDKs) reduce the amount of work required to use Stripe’s REST APIs, starting with reducing the boilerplate code you have to write. Below are the installation instructions for these libraries in a variety of popular server-side programming languages.

You can access certain Stripe products and features in the beta stage with beta SDKs. The versions of these beta SDKs have the beta or b suffix, for example, 5.1.0b3 in Python and 5.1.0-beta.3 in other language SDKs. Try these beta SDKs and share feedback with us before the features reach the stable phase. To learn more about how to use the beta SDKs, read the readme file in the GitHub repository of the individual language SDKs.

## Web SDKs

Stripe provides the following web client SDKs to enable integrations with Stripe Elements, our prebuilt UI components, to create a payment form that lets you securely collect a customer’s card details without handling the sensitive data.

## Mobile device SDKs

Our mobile device helper libraries (also known as Mobile device SDKs) help you create native applications for Apple’s and Android’s devices and platforms. The React Native SDK helps you integrate Stripe into iOS and Android applications built with React Native.

## Community libraries

The following is a list of community-supported libraries that we know about—these libraries aren’t supported by Stripe, and we can’t speak to their accuracy or completeness. But these are open source, so feel free to fork and hack as much as you like.

## Stripe OpenAPI Specification

Stripe’s OpenAPI specification empowers you with a broad set of developer tooling, starting with Postman collections.

## Stripe versioning

Stripe server-side SDKs use Semantic Versioning, whereas Stripe APIs are versioned by the release date. A breaking API change results in an increment in the major version number of the SDK.
