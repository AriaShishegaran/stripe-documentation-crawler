# Disputes and fraud

A dispute (also known as a chargeback) occurs when a cardholder questions your payment with their card issuer.

To process a chargeback, the issuer creates a formal dispute on the card network, which immediately reverses the payment, pulling the money for the payment—as well as one or more network dispute fees—from Stripe. After that, Stripe debits your balance for the payment amount and dispute fee.

To help our users submit the best possible response for each dispute, Stripe provides a guided process within the Dashboard. This allows you to provide all of the necessary text and images that are appropriate to the dispute reason and your counter argument.
