# Moving money with Treasury using CreditReversal objects

Reversing a ReceivedCredit creates a CreditReversal. You can reverse ReceivedCredits only in some scenarios (detailed in the following table). Whether you can reverse a ReceivedCredit depends on the network and source flow.

[CreditReversal](/api/treasury/credit_reversals)

The reversal_details sub-hash on the ReceivedCredit object can have the following combination of values, which determines if you can reverse the ReceivedCredit.
