# Moving money with Treasury using ReceivedCredit objects

When funds move into a financial account, Stripe creates a corresponding ReceivedCredit object on the account. A ReceivedCredit contains information on how the funds were sent and from what account, where possible. You can send funds to a financial account with the accountâ€™s routing and account numbers for ach and us_domestic_wire, or the financial account ID for transfers between financial accounts.

When the origin of the funds is another Treasury financial account, the ReceivedCredit contains a linked_flows.source_flow reference to the originating money movement. In this case, the source OutboundPayment has stripe as its network value.
