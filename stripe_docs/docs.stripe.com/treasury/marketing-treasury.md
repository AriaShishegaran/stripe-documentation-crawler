# Marketing Treasury-based services

Many states have statutory prohibitions on references to “banking," “banks," and “bank accounts” when the entities making these references are not state- or federally-chartered banks or credit unions. Imprecise terminology of Stripe Treasury accounts might draw scrutiny from regulators.

## Yield compliance marketing guidance

As a platform, you can provide your customers with yield, calculated as a percentage of their Treasury balance. We understand that this can be a great value proposition as part of your product. When you market and disclose yield to your potential and existing customers, don’t conflate yield with interest. We’ve outlined best practices for your marketing disclosures below. If you have any questions on how to present yield in your marketing, reach out to our compliance team at platform-compliance@stripe.com

Stripe Treasury balances are stored value accounts that are held “for the benefit of” our Stripe Treasury users with our bank partners, Evolve Bank & Trust and Goldman Sachs Bank USA. We disclose to you which of our partners hold your funds. For FDIC insurance to apply to a user’s balance in a “for the benefit of” account, we must satisfy the rules for FDIC pass-through deposit insurance, unlike a bank account directly with an FDIC insured bank.

We understand that FDIC insurance eligibility can be a valuable feature to your customers. Stripe has approved the variations of the phrase “FDIC Insurance eligible” noted below on marketing materials, as long as certain conditions are met.  Specifically, the statement of FDIC insurance eligibility must always be paired with two disclosures:

- Stripe Treasury Accounts are eligible for FDIC pass-through deposit insurance if they meet certain requirements. The accounts are eligible only to the extent pass-through insurance is permitted by the rules and regulations of the FDIC, and if the requirements for pass-through insurance are satisfied.  The FDIC insurance applies up to 250,000 USD per depositor, per financial institution, for deposits held in the same type of account (business versus personal, and so on).

- You must also disclose that neither Stripe nor you are an FDIC insured institution and that the FDIC’s deposit insurance coverage only protects against the failure of an FDIC insured depository institution.

- “Eligible for FDIC insurance”

- “FDIC insurance-eligible accounts”

- “Eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance”

- “Eligible for FDIC insurance up to the standard maximum deposit insurance per depositor in the same capacity"

- “Eligible for FDIC insurance up to $250K”

- “FDIC insured”

- “FDIC insured accounts”

- “FDIC pass-through insurance guaranteed”

We have also prepared these FAQs that you can use when your customers have questions about FDIC insurance eligibility or any of the disclosures:
