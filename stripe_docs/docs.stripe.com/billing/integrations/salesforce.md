# Integrate Stripe Billing with SalesforceBeta

Combine Stripe Billing and Salesforce for the following benefits:

- Model complex sales contracts using features in Stripe Billing, such as subscription schedules, tiered prices, and usage-based (metered) billing.

- Generate links from within Salesforce to secure Stripe-hosted pages that allow your customers to save a payment method on file.

- View the latest state of subscriptions and invoices of a customer from within Salesforce.
