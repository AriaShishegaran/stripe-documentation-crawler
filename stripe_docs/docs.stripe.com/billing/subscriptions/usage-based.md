[Billing](/billing)

Usage-based billing (also known as metered billing or consumption billing) is a common pricing model for SaaS businesses that enables you to charge based on a customer’s usage of your product or service. As a business, you provide access to your service and bill your customer based on their usage. With Stripe Billing, you can set up and integrate different types of usage-based pricing models with your SaaS product.
