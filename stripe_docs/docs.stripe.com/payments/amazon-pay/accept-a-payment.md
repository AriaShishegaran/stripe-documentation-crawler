# Accept a payment with Amazon Pay

Stripe automatically presents your customers payment method options by evaluating their currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters. We recommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard using the instructions in Accept a payment.

If you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to your customers with Checkout, use this guide (for example, to accept payments in Subscription mode). Otherwise, migrate to the dashboard.

Amazon Pay is a single-use payment method where customers are required to authenticate their payment. Customers are redirected from your website or app, authorize the payment with Amazon, then return to your website or app. You get immediate notification of whether the payment succeeded or failed.
