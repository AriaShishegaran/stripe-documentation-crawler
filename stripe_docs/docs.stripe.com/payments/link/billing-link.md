# Link with Billing

Use Link with the Hosted Invoice Page to let your customers pay invoices faster. Stripe assigns all invoices a unique URL that you can send to your customer. We host these invoices, which means you can securely collect payments without any extra implementation code. Link is compatible with both the Invoices and Subscriptions APIs.
