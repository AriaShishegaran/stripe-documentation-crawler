# Payment Element and Card Element comparison

Previously, each payment method (cards, iDEAL, etc.) required integrating a separate Element. Now, you can use the Payment Element to accept payments from one or multiple payment methods. Since this also includes cards, you have the option to integrate the Card Element or the Payment Element to accept card payments.

For most users, the Payment Element is the best option to process cards. The integration effort is the same as the Card Element and it supports all the common payment flows. It also gives you instant access to additional payment methods, including Google Pay and Apple Pay. Accepting more payment methods can help your business expand its global reach and improve checkout conversion.
