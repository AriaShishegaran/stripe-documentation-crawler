Real-time payment methods let customers directly transfer money from their bank account or alternate funding source using an authenticating intermediary, like a phone number. Because this payment method type increases transaction speeds, it can improve conversion rates. Stripe supports real-time payments in Brazil, Singapore, Thailand, Sweden, and India.

## Payment process

The real-time payment method process is as follows:

- Stripe sends the customer an identifier that lists the payable amount.

- The customer makes the payment through their application or third-party service.

- The application or third-party service communicates with the customers bank to secure the funds.

When a customer uses a real-time payment method, their statement lists the application or third-party service as the payment type.
