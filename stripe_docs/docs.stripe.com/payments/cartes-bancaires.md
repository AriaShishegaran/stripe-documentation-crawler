Cartes Bancaires is France’s local card network. More than 95% of these cards are co-branded with either Visa or Mastercard, meaning you can process these cards over either Cartes Bancaires or the Visa or Mastercard networks. Businesses processing co-badged cards in the EEA must provide customers a choice of which network they prefer at checkout time. See our guide for co-badged cards compliance for more information.

Cartes Bancaires will likely have a positive effect on your acceptance rate in France. If a charge is declined on the Cartes Bancaires network for a technical reason, Stripe automatically retries the charge on Visa or Mastercard’s networks.

As with Visa and Mastercard, cardholders can dispute Cartes Bancaires charges. Because Cartes Bancaires dispute rules are more stringent, there are fewer reasons that a cardholder can dispute a charge, which on average leads to a lower dispute rate compared to Visa and Mastercard for many of our merchants. Merchants cannot contest Cartes Bancaires disputes - the dispute fee is 0 Euro on Cartes Bancaires.
