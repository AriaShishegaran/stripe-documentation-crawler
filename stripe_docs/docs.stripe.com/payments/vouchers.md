# Vouchers

Voucher payment methods are different from gift vouchers. If you want to issue gift vouchers, try promos and discounts with Checkout.

[Checkout](/payments/checkout/discounts)

With vouchers, customers complete online purchases in-person at authorized locations like convenience stores. Vouchers are often used by:

- Businesses with customers that donâ€™t have cards or bank accounts.

- Retailers with consumers in countries like Mexico, where card authorizations rates are low and offering a backup payment option improves conversion.

Vouchers might not be a good fit for your business if:

- You deliver goods immediately after checkout. Some customers may not complete payment and it can take one business day to receive a payment confirmation.

- You need to send refunds. Not all vouchers support refunds. Some businesses create separate processes to credit customers who ask for a refund directly.

## Payment experience

When a customer chooses a voucher method for payment, they receive a digital voucher through email or in an app with a transaction summary and a voucher code. The customer scans the voucher code at an authorized location like a convenience store and pays in-person, often with cash.

## Product support

All voucher methods work on PaymentIntents. We build hosted voucher experiences for you to simplify your integration. Contact us to request a new voucher method.
