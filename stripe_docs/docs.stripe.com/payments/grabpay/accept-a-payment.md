Stripe automatically presents your customers payment method options by evaluating their currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters. We recommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard using the instructions in Accept a payment.

If you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to your customers with Checkout, use this guide (for example, to accept payments in Subscription mode). Otherwise, migrate to the dashboard.

GrabPay is a single-use payment method. Customers pay with GrabPay by redirecting from your website to GrabPay to authorize the payment. After that, they will automatically be redirected back to your website. You will get immediate notification on whether the payment succeeded or failed.
