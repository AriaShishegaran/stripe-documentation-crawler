# Mastercard Installments

Mastercard Installments enables merchants to leverage their existing Mastercard relationship to accept installment payments from a network of Lenders and Issuers (Installment Program Providers). Mastercard automatically enrolls merchants accepting Mastercard into participating in Mastercard Installments.

Buyers who have received a Mastercard Installments virtual card through their bank can pay for purchases in four interest free installments by entering their payment information on the checkout page like a typical transaction. Mastercard installments are charged according to the same fee structure applicable to your Mastercard card charges. Surcharging is prohibited.
