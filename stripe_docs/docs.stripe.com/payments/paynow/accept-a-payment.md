# Accept a PayNow payment

Stripe automatically presents your customers payment method options by evaluating their currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters. We recommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard using the instructions in Accept a payment.

If you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to your customers with Checkout, use this guide (for example, to accept payments in Subscription mode). Otherwise, migrate to the dashboard.

PayNow is a single-use payment method. Customers pay with PayNow by scanning the QR code that they see during Checkout. Completing the payment redirects customers back to your website.

[Test your integration](#test-integration)

## Test your integration

When testing your Checkout integration, select PayNow as the payment method and click the Generate QR code button, which creates and renders a QR code.

In test mode, scan the QR code with a QR code scanning application on your mobile device. The QR code payload contains a URL which brings you to a Stripe-hosted PayNow test payment page where you can either authorize or fail the test payment.

In live mode, you will be able to scan the QR code using a preferred banking app or payment app that supports PayNow.
