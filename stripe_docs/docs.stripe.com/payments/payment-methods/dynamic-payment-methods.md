# Dynamic payment methods

Dynamic payment methods is part of the default Stripe integration and enables you to configure payment methods settings from the Dashboardâ€”no code required. When you use dynamic payment methods in a Payment Element or Checkout integration, Stripe handles the logic for dynamically displaying the most relevant eligible payment methods to each customer to maximize conversion. Dynamic payment methods also unlocks customization features to help you customize and experiment with payment methods.

Use dynamic payment methods to:

- Turn on and manage most payment methods in the Dashboard

- Eliminate the need to specify eligibility requirements for individual payment methods

- Dynamically order eligible payment methods to maximize conversion based on factors such as customer device, location, and local currency

- Set rules when payment methods are shown to buyers

- Run A/B Tests for new payment methods before rolling them out to buyers
