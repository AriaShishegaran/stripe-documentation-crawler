Each family has similar features, a single integration, and common checkout experiences. After you’ve integrated one payment method, you can add another within the same family with minimal changes to your integration.

To learn more about which payment methods are right for your business, see our payment method guide.

[payment method guide](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide)

If you’re building an integration with Stripe Elements, Link facilitates frictionless payments for your customers. Your customers can save, change, and manage all their payment details in Link without any impact to your integration. Meanwhile, as Stripe adds support for more payment methods to Link, your integration can automatically accept them, without requiring you to make changes to your Payment methods settings.
