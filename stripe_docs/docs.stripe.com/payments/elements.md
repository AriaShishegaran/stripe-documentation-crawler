# Stripe Web Elements

Stripe Elements is a set of prebuilt UI components for building your web checkout flow. It’s available as a feature of Stripe.js, our foundational JavaScript library for building payment flows. Stripe.js tokenizes sensitive payment details within an Element without ever having them touch your server.
