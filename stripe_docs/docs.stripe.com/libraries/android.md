# Stripe Android SDK

The Stripe Android SDK allows you to quickly build a payment flow in your Android app. We provide powerful and customizable UI elements that you can use out-of-the-box to collect your users’ payment details. We also expose the low-level APIs that underpin those UIs so that you can build fully custom experiences.
