# Stripe iOS SDK

The Stripe iOS SDK helps you build customizable payments into your iOS app. We provide powerful and customizable UI screens and elements that you can use out-of-the-box to collect your users’ payment details. We also expose the low-level APIs that enable those UIs so that you can build fully custom payments.
