## Create a payment link

Before you begin, decide what pricing model works best for you:

- Products or subscriptions: Best for e-commerce or SaaS where you’re selling products for a fixed price.

- Customers choose what to pay: Best for donations, tipping, or pay-what-you-want. This pricing model currently doesn’t support recurring payments or recurring donations. Learn more about the requirements for accepting tips or donations.

If you want to create product or subscription, create a payment link by completing the following steps:

- In the Dashboard, open the Payment Links page and click +New (or click the plus sign () and select Payment link).

## Payment Links on mobile

If you’re creating a product or subscription, use the Stripe Dashboard iOS app to create a payment link on your mobile device. In the app, go to Payments > Payment Links to create a payment link (or click the create icon () and select Payment link). The iOS app doesn’t currently support creating links where your customers choose how much to pay.
