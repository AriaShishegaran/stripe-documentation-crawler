## Key features

Manage your Stripe resources with the Stripe CLI pre-loaded with autocomplete. No more hunting around for commands—start typing stripe and hit the space bar on your keyboard then click a supported command.

Launch the Stripe Shell from the Stripe docs site to easily try out different combinations of Stripe API requests before writing a line of code.

Run any supported Stripe CLI command directly within the Stripe docs site. When you click the green play button next to any supported CLI command, the Stripe Shell runs the request and returns an immediate response in the terminal window.

While the Stripe Shell can’t test a webhooks integration on your local server, it’s still possible to use the Stripe CLI to forward and trigger webhook events locally. To learn more, see Test a webhooks integration with the Stripe CLI.
