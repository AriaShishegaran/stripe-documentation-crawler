After you finalize and send a quote to your customer, you might need to make additional changes. For example, you want to apply a discount or fee. Stripe lets you duplicate a finalized quote, which creates a new draft quote with the same details as the original. You can update the new draft quote until ​​you’re ready to finalize and send it to your customer. If the quote is an open state, you can duplicate or revise it.
