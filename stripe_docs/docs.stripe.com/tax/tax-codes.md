Stripe Tax uses product tax codes (PTCs) to associate products with tax rates. For example, a jurisdiction can charge one tax rate for products in the Clothing & Footwear category and a different tax rate for products in the School Uniforms category.  Every product in Stripe can have a product tax code assigned.

Each product tax code is associated with a Tax Code object in the Stripe API.

[Tax Code object](/api/tax_codes/object)

The following table describes the available product tax codes. If a product doesn’t fit any of the specific codes, use one of the codes with “General” in its name.
