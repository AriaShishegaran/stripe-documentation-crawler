## Thresholds

Stripe Tax provides insights about your potential tax registration obligations (called economic nexus in the US). We help you understand which state or country you might have such obligations in, even if your business doesn’t have a physical presence there.

You can monitor tax obligations in the following categories:

- Threshold exceeded: Where your estimated sales or transactions are over the location’s threshold and your business likely needs to register for tax.

- To monitor: Where you haven’t exceeded a threshold yet, but you do have buyers located in that market. We’ll provide a percent-to-threshold to help you determine when you might need to register.

- Unattributed revenue: When Stripe Tax isn’t able to determine the location for a transaction, we group its information under this category. Where possible, we break out globally unattributed revenue and US unattributed revenue.

## Registrations

Use the Registrations tab to manage locations and access reports where you have a tax registration. Registrations enable you to calculate and collect tax with Stripe. Locations are either Active, Scheduled, or Expired.

To start calculating and collecting tax for a location, you must add a registration in Stripe Tax. You need to identify each state, province, and country where you have tax obligations. You need to register with the local tax authority to collect tax for each tax obligation. Registration requirements vary by each location (often referred to as nexus in the US).

To add a registration in the Dashboard:

- Click +Add registration and select the country and the applicable state or province.

- Add the date to start tax collection as provided by your local tax authority.

- Save your changes.

To maintain your compliance, you might need to edit your registration. Your local tax authority will inform you of any updates to your information or dates.

To edit a registration:

- Click the overflow menu () next to the applicable registration.

- Click Edit registration.

- Save your changes.

To stop calculating and collecting tax for a location, you must end the tax obligation’s  registration.

To end a registration:

- Click the overflow menu () next to the applicable registration.

- Add the date (provided by your local tax authority) to stop tax collection.

- Save your changes.

You can export your transaction data into either an itemized or summarized report at the line item, imposition, and jurisdiction level for all locations where you have Stripe Tax is enabled.

To export transaction data:

- Click Export transactions.

- Select either Itemized export or Summarized export as needed.

- Click Download.

After you download the report, click View Report.

US location reports aggregate your transaction data in the chosen location for a specific filing period based on the state filing requirements. You can create them for any US location where you have Stripe Tax enabled.
