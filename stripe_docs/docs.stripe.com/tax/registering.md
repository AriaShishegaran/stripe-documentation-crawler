As a business, you have an obligation to identify the states, provinces, and countries where you have tax obligations. You must then register with the tax authorities in those respective jurisdictions and add your registrations to Stripe using the Registrations tab of the Tax Dashboard.

Registration requirements vary by jurisdiction, and you can trigger it in a few ways, including, but not limited to:

- Building offices

- Employee locations

- Inventory locations

- Products sold

- Buyer locations

When you’ve met the requirements to start collecting tax in a local jurisdiction or foreign country, register with that jurisdiction before you begin collecting. Typically the registration process requires submitting general business and industry information (like your product catalog), and financial information (like total sales). The time it takes to complete a registration varies by jurisdiction. Additionally, some jurisdictions might require you to file returns even if you don’t have any collected tax to remit. Stripe recommends you consult with your tax advisor to determine your businesses tax obligations in regard to registering for indirect or consumption tax.

## Track your registrations in the Dashboard

When you register to collect tax in a jurisdiction, use the Registrations tab of the Dashboard to add the registration to Stripe. That’s necessary for Stripe to calculate and collect the taxes you owe and for you to manage calculations and view reports for each location in which you’re collecting tax.

[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax/registrations)

To start calculating and collecting tax for a location, you must add a registration in Stripe. You need to identify each state, province, and country where you have tax obligations. You need to register with the local tax authority to collect tax for each tax obligation. Registration requirements vary by each location (often referred to as nexus in the US).

To add a registration in the Dashboard:

[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations)

- Add the date to start tax collection as provided by your local tax authority.

- Save your changes.

To maintain your compliance, you might need to edit your registration. Your local tax authority will inform you of any updates to your information or dates.

To edit a registration:

- Click the overflow menu () next to the applicable registration.

- Click Edit registration.

- Save your changes.

To stop calculating and collecting tax for a location, you must end the tax obligation’s registration.

To end a registration:

- Click the overflow menu () next to the applicable registration.

- Add the date (provided by your local tax authority) to stop tax collection.
