In Italy, the Vatican City is outside of the scope of the standard tax system and might have different rules that apply. Stripe won’t calculate tax for customers based there, even if you’ve added a registration for Italy. Learn more about how Stripe handles excluded territories.

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to Italy. Stripe doesn’t file taxes on your behalf. For Europe, we recommend using our partners Taxually or Marosa, who can help manage your filing and remittance.
