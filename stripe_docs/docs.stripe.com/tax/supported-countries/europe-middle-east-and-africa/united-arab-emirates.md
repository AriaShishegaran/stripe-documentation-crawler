If you’re located outside the UAE, you must register in the UAE as soon as you perform taxable sales in the UAE and where no other person is obligated to pay the due VAT on these supplies in the UAE (no reverse charge applies). The registration deadline is within 30 days of performing the first taxable sale.

For example, if you’re based in the US and sell digital services to UAE consumers, you must register within 30 days of performing the first sale. However, if you only sell to UAE businesses, you don’t need to register because such sales are subject to reverse charge.

Threshold: 1 transaction

Included transactions: Any taxable transactions that reverse charge doesn’t apply to.
