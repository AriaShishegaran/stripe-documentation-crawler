# Collect tax in Kenya

Collect tax on transactions in Kenya from 22 April 2024

In Kenya, Stripe only supports collecting VAT for electronic, internet and digital marketplace supplies. In Stripe, these are referred to as “digital products.” To collect this tax on Stripe, you must be a remote seller without a physical presence in the country.

## When to register for tax collection

Use the Thresholds tab to get insights about your potential tax registration obligations in Kenya. Stripe also notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to collect tax. Learn more about how the monitoring tool works.

Remote sellers providing digital goods or electronically supplied services (digital products) to both businesses and individuals in Kenya have no registration threshold; they must register for VAT within 30 days after the first sale.

Threshold: 1 transaction Included transactions: Business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) sales of digital goods or electronically supplied services (digital products)

## How we calculate taxes

We only support calculations for digital products (non-physical items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in Kenya. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital product tax code.
