Remote sellers must register for VAT if their taxable turnover in Iceland exceeds 2,000,000 ISK within any 12-month period, and it requires fiscal representation. Remote sellers who provide electronically supplied services and subscriptions to physical papers and magazines for Icelandic consumers can use a simplified registration procedure (VOES) that doesn’t require fiscal representation. Sales to VAT-registered businesses where the customer pays for the VAT through the reverse charge mechanism don’t count towards the threshold.

Threshold: 2,000,000 ISK

Period: 12 months

Included transactions: Any taxable transactions that reverse charge doesn’t apply to.
