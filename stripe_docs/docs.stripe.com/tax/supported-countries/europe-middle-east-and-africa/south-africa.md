A non-resident business supplying goods and services in South Africa becomes liable to be registered if the total value of taxable sales is more than 1 million ZAR in a 12-month period, or is expected to exceed this amount. Where a non-resident company is liable to register for VAT purposes, they must appoint a VAT representative. The obligation to appoint a VAT representative doesn’t apply to providers of digital services.

Non-residents supplying digital services from a place outside South Africa to South African customers (both B2B and B2C) must register by the end of any month if they exceed the threshold of 1 million ZAR  in any consecutive 12-month period and any two of the following three circumstances apply:

- The recipient of the services is a resident of South Africa

- The payment for the services originates from a bank registered under the Banks Act 94 of 1990 (the Banks Act)

- The recipient of the services has a business, residential, or postal address in South Africa

For example, if you’re based outside of South Africa and sell digital services to consumers in South Africa and cross the threshold during any 12-month period (from February of the past year to January of the current year, for example) you must register by the end of the month that you crossed the threshold in.

Threshold: 1 million ZAR

Period: 12 months

Included transactions: Any taxable transaction.
