If you’re based outside Switzerland and your global turnover exceeds 100,000 CHF or will exceed this amount in the next 12 months, you must register for VAT in Switzerland within 30 days of performing the first taxable transaction. The obligation to register doesn’t apply if:

- You only sell to Swiss businesses (B2B sales) and the sales are subject to reverse charge in Switzerland.

- You only provide tax exempt services to customers in Switzerland.

Threshold: 100,000 CHF (global)

Period: 12 months

Included transactions: Any taxable transactions that reverse charge doesn’t apply to.

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe calculates VAT for your transactions in Switzerland.

Generally, most transactions are taxable in the jurisdiction where your customer is. Stripe assumes the sale of most goods or services to be taxable unless specifically exempted.
