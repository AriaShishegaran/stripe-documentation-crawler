## How we calculate taxes

If your origin address is in the US and differs from your customer’s state, Stripe always calculates tax based on your customer’s location.

If your customer is in Ohio and your origin address is also in Ohio, Stripe applies tax based on your origin address, depending on the type of product or service you sell.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. To access these reports, navigate to the Registrations tab of the Dashboard.

The tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of transactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn more about tax reporting exports.

Location reports offer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and align with Ohio filing requirements. You have the option to report on an annual, semiannual, or monthly basis.

You are responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to Ohio. Stripe doesn’t file taxes on your behalf. For automating filing in the US, we recommend using TaxJar’s AutoFile solution.
