## How we calculate taxes

If your origin address is in the US and differs from your customer’s state, Stripe always calculates tax based on your customer’s location.

If your customer is in Missouri and your origin address is also in Missouri, Stripe applies tax based on your origin address, depending on the type of product or service you sell.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. To access these reports, navigate to the Registrations tab of the Dashboard.
