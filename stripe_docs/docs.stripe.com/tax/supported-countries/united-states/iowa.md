Sellers that meet the sales thresholds must register for an Iowa sales tax permit, collect sales tax on sales that ship into Iowa, and remit that sales tax to the state. For those under the threshold, it’s voluntary, but you can register for an Iowa Retailer’s Use Tax (RUT) permit (also voluntary). If you’ve already registered for the RUT and go over the economic threshold, you’ll need to cancel your RUT and register for an Iowa sales tax permit.

Threshold: 100,000 USD

Period: Previous or current year

Included transactions: Gross sales

Effective date: January 1, 2019
