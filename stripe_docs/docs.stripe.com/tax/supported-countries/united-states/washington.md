According to the state, sellers with sales equal to or exceeding the sales number thresholds must register for a Washington sales tax permit, collect sales tax on sales that ship into Washington, and remit that sales tax to the state.

Prior to March 14, 2019, remote sellers could also have economic nexus if they had 200 or more transactions in the state. And, effective July 1, 2019, SSB Bill 5581 eliminated both the notice and reporting requirements established in the state’s 2018 Marketplace Fairness law in addition to the 200 transaction trigger. If you previously registered because you met the 200 transaction threshold, assess your sales to see if you exceed the 100,000 USD threshold. If you do, continue to collect and submit retail sales tax.

Location reports offer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and align with Washington filing requirements. You have the option to report on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis.

Reporting-specific considerations:

- Washington requires wholesale sales to be identified because they’re subject to a lower tax rate instead of being completely exempt. When a report contains any customer-exempt transactions, it displays a warning message. For a detailed breakdown of each transaction, export the transaction data.
