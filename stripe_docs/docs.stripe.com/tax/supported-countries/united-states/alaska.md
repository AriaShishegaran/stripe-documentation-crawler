# Collect tax in Alaska

## When to register for tax collection

Alaska doesn’t have a state sales tax. However local jurisdictions within Alaska may impose a sales and use tax. Each jursidiction can define what it means to be doing business in that location and whether sales tax applies. Many local jurisdictions in Alaska have chosen to adopt the Alaska Remote Seller Sales Tax Commission (ARSSTC) uniform tax code. This includes using state-wide thresholds to determine whether a business needs to pay tax there.

Businesses who are remote sellers or marketplace facilitators need to register with the commission and collect tax on their sales into member Alaska localities if they have 100,000 USD or more in annual gross receipts from sales, or 200 or more sales annually into the state.

Threshold: 100,000 USD or 200 transactions

Period: Previous or current year

Included transactions: Gross sales

Effective date: The state passed The Alaska Remote Seller Sales Tax Code on January 6, 2020. However, local jurisdictions decide whether to adopt the code. After a local jurisdiction adopts the code, businesses have 30 days to begin collecting sales tax from Alaska buyers located in that jurisdiction.
