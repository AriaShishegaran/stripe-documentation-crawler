Remote sellers with no physical presence in Alabama can register for the Simplified Sellers Use Tax. The program allows you to collect a single tax rate on all sales into the state, instead of collecting local taxes. You can collect this tax after enrolling on the My Alabama Taxes website.

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe calculates the taxes that apply to your customer’s location.

If you selected the Simplified Sellers Use Tax program in Stripe then we will calculate and collect the simplified rate. You can change this by editing the tax registration on the Dashboard.
