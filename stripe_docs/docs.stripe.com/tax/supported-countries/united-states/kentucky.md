Sellers that meet either the sales or transaction number thresholds must register for a Kentucky sales tax permit, collect sales tax on sales that ship into Kentucky, and remit that sales tax to the state.

Threshold: 100,000 USD or 200 transactions

Period: Previous or current year

Included transactions: Gross sales

Effective date: July 1, 2018

We also support:

- Kentucky State and Local Communications Tax—for businesses selling video streaming to customers in Kentucky. This includes the Multi Channel Video Programming Excise Tax and Utility Gross Receipts License Tax. These taxes only apply when your business has physical presence in Kentucky. This means there isn’t a revenue threshold for when remote sellers need to pay this tax. Transactions for these taxes aren’t included in Stripe monitoring for Kentucky. The linked page is only accesible within the US or via a VPN.

Location reports offer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and align with Kentucky filing requirements. You have the option to report on an annual, fiscal year, quarterly, or monthly basis.

Reporting-specific considerations:

- The location reports don’t include transactions with the Kentucky State and Local Communications Tax as these are filed to the state using a different report. To see transactions with these taxes, you can use the exports.

You are responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to Kentucky. Stripe doesn’t file taxes on your behalf. For automating filing in the US, we recommend using TaxJar’s AutoFile solution.
