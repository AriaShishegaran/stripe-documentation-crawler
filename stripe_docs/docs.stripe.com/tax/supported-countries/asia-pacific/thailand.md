# Collect tax in Thailand

In Thailand, Stripe only supports collecting VAT for digital services. In Stripe, these are referred to as “digital products.” To collect this tax on Stripe, you must be a remote seller without a physical presence in the country.

Remote sellers supplying digital goods and services to Thai consumers are required to register for VAT purposes if their taxable sales of digital goods and services exceed THB 1.8 million. The threshold period is an accounting period (for corporations) or a calendar year (for individuals). Remote sellers are required to register for VAT within 30 days from the day they have satisfied the registration threshold. As accounting periods vary per company, Stripe uses a calendar year as the threshold period.

Threshold: THB 1.8 million

Time frame: Calendar year

Included transactions: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods and services

## How we calculate taxes

We only support calculations for digital products (non-physical items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in Thailand. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital product tax code.
