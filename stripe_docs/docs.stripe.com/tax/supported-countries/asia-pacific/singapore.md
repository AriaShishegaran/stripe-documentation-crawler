Remote sellers must register for GST if the Singaporean taxable turnover exceeded 1 million SGD in the past 12 months (retrospective basis) or is likely to exceed 1 million SGD in the next 12 months (prospective basis).

A special registration rule applies to remote sellers of digital services. As of Jan 1, 2020, non-resident suppliers must register under the Overseas Vendor Registration regime if in a calendar year:

- They have a global turnover exceeding 1 million SGD.

- They make B2C supplies of digital services to customers in Singapore exceeding 100,000 SGD. Global turnover refers to all supplies made that would be taxable supplies if made in Singapore.

Stripe only monitors the 100,000 SGD threshold of the Overseas Vendor Registration.
