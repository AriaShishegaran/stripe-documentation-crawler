# Collect tax in Indonesia

In Indonesia, Stripe only supports collecting VAT for digital goods and services. In Stripe, these are referred to as “digital products.” To collect this tax on Stripe, you must be a remote seller without a physical presence in the country.

Remote sellers providing digital goods or electronically supplied services (digital products) to Indonesian customers are appointed as VAT collectors when they meet either of the following thresholds:

- The total value of digital goods and services provided to customers in Indonesia exceeds IDR 600 million in a period of 12 months or IDR 50 million in one calendar month.

- Website traffic in Indonesia exceeds 12,000 users in one year or 1,000 users in one month.

Remote sellers who meet the registration thresholds can ask to be appointed a VAT collector and start collecting VAT voluntarily but aren’t obligated to do so.

Stripe only monitors the threshold of 50 million IDR per calendar month.

Threshold: 50 million IDR

Time frame: Calendar month

Included transactions: Sales of digital goods and services

## How we calculate taxes

We only support calculations for digital products (non-physical items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in Indonesia. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital product tax code.
