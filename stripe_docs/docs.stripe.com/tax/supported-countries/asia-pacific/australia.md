Remote sellers supplying goods or services in Australia must register if their taxable turnover from these transactions exceeded 75,000 AUD within the past 12-month period or will exceed this amount in the next 12 months.

These rules also apply to businesses supplying remote services such as digital content or low-value goods from outside Australia to customers who are residents of Australia and aren’t registered for GST. Sales to Australian GST-registered businesses that are subject to reverse charge don’t count towards the threshold. The registration threshold for non-resident non-profit organizations is 150,000 AUD.

Stripe doesn’t support the non-profit organization specific threshold.

Threshold: 75,000 AUD (or 150,000 AUD for non-profit organizations)

Time frame: Previous or current year.

Included transactions: Any taxable transactions that reverse charge doesn’t apply to.
