# Collect tax from Hong Kong

## When to register for tax collection

Hong Kong doesn’t impose VAT or sales tax. This means you won’t see an option to add your registration for Hong Kong to Stripe and collect taxes from your customers based in Hong Kong.

However Hong Kong does impose other taxes on businesses, including a profits tax. Learn more about the taxes that apply in Hong Kong at the tax authority.

If you’re a business based in Hong Kong you could still have tax obligations based on sales to customers in other locations. Use the Thresholds tab to get insights about your potential tax registration obligations. Stripe also notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to collect tax. Learn more about how the monitoring tool works.

After you’ve registered to collect tax in a location, add your registrations to Stripe in the Registrations tab in the Dashboard. This turns on tax calculation and collection in Stripe for your transactions in that location.

## How we calculate taxes

Generally, most transactions are taxable in the jurisdiction where your customer is. Stripe assumes the sale of most goods or services to be taxable unless specifically exempted.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. To access these reports, navigate to the Registrations tab of the Dashboard. Learn more about the different types of reports.

You are responsible for filing and remitting your taxes. Stripe doesn’t file taxes on your behalf.
