# Collect tax in Canada

The Canadian tax system consists of a combination of federal and provincial taxes. The goods and services tax (GST) applies nationally. The different provinces handle taxes in a variety of ways. Learn more in our guide to tax in Canada.

Provincial sales taxes in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Prince Edward Island are combined with the GST to implement the harmonized sales tax (HST), which operates in the same way as the GST.

Separate taxes are collected in:

- British Columbia—provincial sales tax (PST)

- Manitoba—retail sales tax (RST)

- Quebec—Quebec sales tax (QST)

- Saskatchewan—provincial sales tax (PST)

Alberta, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon don’t apply any provincial sales tax.

## When to register for tax collection

The Canadian federal government and the four provinces that levy a separate provincial sales tax have their own tax registration thresholds and procedures. Use the Thresholds tab to get insights about your potential tax registration obligations in Canada. Stripe also notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to collect tax. Learn more about how the monitoring tool works.

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe determines whether federal tax (GST or HST), provincial tax (PST, QST, or RST) or a combination of both types of taxes apply to the specific transaction.

Sales of goods and services within Canada are generally taxable at the location of the customer. Sales of goods shipped from Canada to customers in other countries are generally treated as a zero-rated export from the Canadian tax perspective. Sales of services that are provided from Canada to customers in other countries are generally not taxable in Canada but the tax of the customer country may apply.

Sales of services provided to Canadian customers by sellers established in other countries are generally taxable in Canada. While tax is usually collected on sales to private persons, no tax is charged on sales  to business customers who provide the seller with their tax identification number or a certificate of exemption.
