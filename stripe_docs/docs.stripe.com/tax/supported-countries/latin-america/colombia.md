# Collect tax in Colombia

In Colombia, Stripe only supports collecting VAT for digital services. In Stripe, these are referred to as “digital products.” To collect this tax on Stripe, you must be a remote seller without a physical presence in the country.

## When to register for tax collection

Use the Thresholds tab to get insights about your potential tax registration obligations in Colombia. Stripe also notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to collect tax. Learn more about how the monitoring tool works.

Remote sellers providing digital goods or electronically supplied services (digital products) to consumers in Colombia have no registration threshold; they must register for VAT purposes from the first sale. Sales to business customers in Colombia don’t trigger any tax registration obligations as remote sellers aren’t required to collect tax on such sales.

Threshold: 1 transaction

Included transactions: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods or electronically supplied services (digital products)
