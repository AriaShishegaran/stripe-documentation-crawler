## When and how to register for tax collection

Different rules determine when and how you need to register to collect tax depending on the country. Click the links above to learn about the thresholds for tax collection in each location.

Use the Thresholds tab to get insights about your potential tax registration obligations in each location. Stripe only monitors if you have reached a tax threshold for sales outside of the country your business is based in. Stripe also notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to collect tax. Learn more about how the monitoring tool works.

In Chile, Colombia, and Mexico your business needs to be a remote seller with no physical presence (such as a shop or warehouse) to collect tax on Stripe.

After you’ve registered with a country, add your registration to Stripe in the Registrations tab in the Dashboard to start collecting tax on your transactions in that location.

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe only supports calculation for digital products in Chile, Colombia, and Mexico sold by remote sellers.

A transaction where your business and your customer are in the same country is called a domestic transaction. Stripe doesn’t yet support calculation on domestic transactions in this region.

A cross-border transaction is where your customer is located in a different country to your business or when goods are shipped from one country to another.

Stripe calculates tax on a cross-border transaction taking into account the following factors:

- the location of your business

- the tax registrations you’ve added to Stripe

- the location of the buyer

- the type of the product sold (based on which product tax code you assigned to your product)

[product tax code](/tax/tax-codes)

- the status of the customer (whether they’re an individual or a business)

Digital products are non-physical items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically. This includes digital goods and electronically supplied services. We determine whether you’re selling digital products or physical goods using the product tax code you assigned to your product.

Digital products are generally taxable in the country where your customer is located. However sales of digital products to businesses in other countries might have reverse charge applied. With reverse charge, your business provides an invoice for the purchase so that your customer can calculate the tax.

When physical goods are shipped to a customer in a different country to your business, the transaction is referred to as an export. Stripe doesn’t yet support calculation on exports of physical goods in this region.
