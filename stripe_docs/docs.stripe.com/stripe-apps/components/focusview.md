# FocusView

A FocusView component can be opened from other View components and allows the developer to open a dedicated space for the end user to complete a specific task. Examples include:

- Enter details to create a new entry in a database

- Go through a wizard to decide on next steps

- Confirm that the user wants to take the action they indicated

FocusView must be a child of ContextView. Donâ€™t wrap the FocusView in a conditional, instead use the shown property to control its visible state. For more information, see ContextView.

To control when the close confirmation dialog displays, you can use state to conditionally pass confirmCloseMessages to the FocusView, like in the following example:
