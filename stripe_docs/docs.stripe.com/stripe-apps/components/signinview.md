# SignInView

Use the SignInView component to display a graphic with your app’s icon next to Stripe’s, a short description of your sign in process, action buttons, and so on.  If your app requires users to sign in, the SignInView component is required to make sure users clearly understand that they’re connecting to Stripe.

## Additional context

Before a user signs in, you might want to display a demo, a detailed description of your app, or screenshots of the experience. Remember that at this point the user has already installed your app so they should be motivated to sign in, but if you want to show additional context, you can do it in a focused view using the descriptionActionLabel, descriptionActionTitle, and descriptionActionContents properties.
