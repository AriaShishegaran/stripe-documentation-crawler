# Menu

To add the Menu component to your app:

A basic menu is made up of an element to trigger the menu, and a series of MenuItems.

## Items

Menus contain multiple vertically arranged items.

## Groups

You can divide items in a menu into groups.

## Events

Use the onAction prop as a callback to handle press events on items. You can provde the onAction prop to the Menu to handle item activation across all items, or to the MenuItem directly to handle activation for individual items.

## Triggers

The menu trigger property works together with the menu to link the menu’s open state with a trigger’s pressed state.
