# ButtonGroup

To add the ButtonGroup component to your app:

## Overflow collapsing

Button groups responsively adapt to the space available in their container by collapsing buttons into an overflow menu. Primary buttons collapse after any other buttons, and larger buttons collapse first.

If you want to turn off collapsing behavior, you can specify the collapse="none" prop value.

## Customizing the overflow menu trigger

You can replace the default overflow menu trigger with any element that supports onPress events. To adhere to best practices, remember to add an appropriate aria-label to your trigger element if it doesnâ€™t contain descriptive text.
