# Accordion

To add the Accordion component to your app:

Accordions help a user to quickly scan a collection, identify elements, and access more details without leaving the context that they’re working in.

To add the Accordion component to your app:

This is a preview of an Accordion component with three AccordionItem components inside:

## AccordionItem

Accordion components contain one or more AccordionItem components.

Label all AccordionItem components with a title that uniquely identifies the item. You can also use an optional subtitle to provide a description or additional relevant information.

The AccordionItem component can contain a media element to show a relevant icon or image that helps the user identify the item. Only include media when it helps users identify items and when there’s a strong association between the media and the item itself.

You can represent actions that an item can have performed on it with buttons or links placed on the right-hand side of the accordion trigger.

Instead of removing a user’s ability to interact with disabled accordion items, disable the associated actions while still presenting as much information within the item as possible to the user.
