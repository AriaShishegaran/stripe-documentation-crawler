# Button

To add the Button component to your app:

There are multiple button types available:

Buttons support these CSS properties:

[Layout properties](/stripe-apps/style#layout-properties)

[fractional sizing token](/stripe-apps/style#sizing)

[Sizing](/stripe-apps/style#sizing)

Buttons don’t support other CSS. Use the size and type props instead.

## Primary buttons

Primary buttons initiate the primary action of any given page or flow. Avoid having more than one primary button available to the user at a given time.

## Secondary buttons

Secondary buttons are the default and most common buttons in product interfaces. In general, use the secondary style for buttons that aren’t for primary actions.

## Destructive buttons

Use destructive buttons exclusively for actions that result in the destruction of any object or data.

## Button sizes

Buttons are available in three sizes, which determine the height of the element. Buttons can be as wide as needed to fill their container.

- You can use small buttons in contexts where space is limited or to match the size of other, small text such as legal terms, and so on.

- Medium is the default size for buttons.

- You can use large buttons in contexts where a call to action (CTA) needs increased prominence.

## Disabled buttons

## Icons in buttons

Use an icon inside of a button:

[icon](/stripe-apps/components/icon)

## Content guidelines

For example, Update customer. It’s acceptable to break this pattern in the case of common actions like Done, Close, Cancel, Add, or Delete.

When a button performs an action or navigates the user to a location, try to name that action or location within the label.

This applies for most cases except proper nouns and phrases.

Avoid periods, exclamation points, and question marks.

When referring to the user within a button or link, always use second person personal pronouns. Example: Post your status.

## Full-width buttons

Create a full-width Button component using the css prop:

## Opening links in new tabs
