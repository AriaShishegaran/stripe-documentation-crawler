# Tooltip

To add the Tooltip component to your app:

This is a preview of two Tooltip components with each type of label:

Tooltips are overlays that appear when a user hovers or focuses a target element. Use Tooltips to provide additional contextual information about a particular element or subject. You can use tooltips as either descriptions or labels.

Avoid putting any interactive content such as links within a Tooltip, because keyboard users wonâ€™t be able to access it.

## Placement

You can place tooltips in one of 4 primary directions and further align them along a secondary axis, resulting in a total of 12 possible placement options relative to the trigger. The placement automatically adjusts as necessary to ensure the Tooltip remains visible within the viewport.

## Delay

Tooltips have a short delay for when they appear after hovering over their trigger element. You can control the amount of time it takes for a Tooltip to become active on hover using the delay prop. Tooltips always appear immediately when their trigger element receives keyboard focus.

Tooltips appear immediately on hover while another Tooltip is already active.
