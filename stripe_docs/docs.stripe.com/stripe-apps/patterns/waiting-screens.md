## Suggested use

- If users navigate back to Stripe during the onboarding flow, keep them informed about whatâ€™s happening. For example:

- Only add a call-to-action if it leads users to the next step of the onboarding process, or to provide additional context they need to complete in the next step.

- Keep language clear and concise. Avoid providing more context than what users might actually require. For example:

- If you must take users outside of Stripe to connect to your account (not recommended), use a waiting screen that clearly communicates this transition. For example:
