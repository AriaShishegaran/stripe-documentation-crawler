# Lists for Stripe Apps

Use lists to display collections of information.

## Before you begin

Create an app.

[Create an app](/stripe-apps/create-app)

## Suggested use

- If you want the rows in your list to be clickable, use a List component. A List can contain an icon and an image in certain treatments.

- For deeper control of the design, compose a custom list item. Rows in custom lists arenâ€™t clickable. Add a link or button for the user to click.
