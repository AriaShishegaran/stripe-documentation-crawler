# Income statement

The income statement provides a detailed revenue and contra revenue breakdown by month. It shows revenue, contra revenue, expenses, gains, and losses. Contra revenue adjustments are deductions from gross revenue. Applying the contra revenue to your gross revenue results in your net income. Use this report to better understand your net revenue and determine how you want to track contra revenue items.

The report is available to download from our accounting reports page with multiple format options.
