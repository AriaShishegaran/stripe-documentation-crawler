- revenue_recognition.debit_credit_by_customer.1

Because this feature is in beta, the data fields might change.

## Download a report

The following example downloads the debits and credits by summary for May 2021.

First, create a report run using Create a Report Run.

[Create a Report Run](/api/reporting/report_run/create)

To get a report for May 2023, set parameters[interval_start] to 1 May 2023 and parameters[interval_end] to 1 Jun 2023.

Next, check whether the Report Run object succeeds by fetching the report run object:

[Report Run](/api/reporting/report_run/object)

The report run object ID starts with frr_.

When the objectâ€™s status is succeeded, you can download the CSV using its result.id value, as in the following example:

The report run result ID starts with file_.
