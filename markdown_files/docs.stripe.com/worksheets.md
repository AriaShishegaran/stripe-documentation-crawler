Use the in-browser Stripe Shell to practice implementing key business processes.Stripe’s API Worksheets provide a low-friction environment to check your knowledge as you work through becoming a certified Stripe Partner.  The worksheets take you through a narrative that prompts you to:

- Practice using Stripe’s API without leaving your browser
- Find relevant documentation
- Explain how and why the API behaves the way it does

As you work through each prompt, we will provide just-in-time feedback to help you find the information you need, right when you need it.

If you’re training for Stripe’s Partner Program, use these as a follow-up to our e-learning courses.  If you’re learning about Stripe’s APIs on your own, consider first exploring our Quickstart guide on implementing a custom payment flow before starting these worksheets.

Try completing a sample worksheet below to get started, or jump right into a topic you want to check your knowledge of.
