Learn about the supported payment methods for Invoicing.By default, customers can pay invoices with any of the payment methods that you’ve enabled in your Invoice template. In some situations, there might be restrictions that prevent payment methods from being used for an invoice. For instance, a payment method might only operate in one currency or have limitations on the amount that can be paid. If there’s a limitation on a payment method, Stripe won’t automatically select it for you.

### Overdue payments

An invoice is considered overdue when its due date has passed and the invoice hasn’t been paid. By default, Stripe reminds your customer to pay the invoice even after the due date. However, by modifying your Automatic collection settings, you can disable automatic collection on the invoice when it becomes past due.
