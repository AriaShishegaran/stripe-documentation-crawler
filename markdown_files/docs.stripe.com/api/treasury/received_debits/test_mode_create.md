# Report Runs

The Report Run object represents an instance of a report type generated with specific run parameters. Once the object is created, Stripe begins processing the report. When the report has finished running, it will give you a reference to a file where you can retrieve your results. For an overview, see API Access to Reports.

Note that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a live-mode API key.

Endpoints

# Report Types

The Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See API Access to Reports documentation for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.

Note that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a live-mode API key.

# Verification Report

A VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the type and options parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: document, id_number, selfie.

Each VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the FileUpload API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the VerificationSession API.

# Forwarding RequestPreview feature

Instructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment_method into the request.

Stripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.

You can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.

Forwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.
