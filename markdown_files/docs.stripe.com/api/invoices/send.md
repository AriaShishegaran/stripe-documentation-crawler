Stripe will automatically send invoices to customers according to your subscriptions settings. However, if you’d like to manually send an invoice to your customer out of the normal schedule, you can do so. When sending invoices that have already been paid, there will be no reference to the payment in the email.

Requests made in test-mode result in no emails being sent, despite sending an invoice.sent event.

### Parameters

No parameters.

### Returns

Returns the invoice object.

Mark a finalized invoice as void. This cannot be undone. Voiding an invoice is similar to deletion, however it only applies to finalized invoices and maintains a papertrail where the invoice can still be found.

Consult with local regulations to determine whether and how an invoice might be amended, canceled, or voided in the jurisdiction you’re doing business in. You might need to issue another invoice or credit note instead. Stripe recommends that you consult with your legal counsel for advice specific to your business.

### Parameters

No parameters.

### Returns

Returns the voided invoice object.

Invoice Items represent the component lines of an invoice. An invoice item is added to an invoice by creating or updating it with an invoice field, at which point it will be included as an invoice line item within invoice.lines.

Invoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the invoice. This can be particularly useful when combined with a subscription. Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually charge or credit the customer’s card only at the end of a regular billing cycle. This is useful for combining several charges (to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing totals.

# Meters

A billing meter is a resource that allows you to track usage of a particular event. For example, you might create a billing meter to track the number of API calls made by a particular user. You can then attach the billing meter to a price and attach the price to a subscription to charge the user for the number of API calls they make.

Endpoints
Show

# Meter Events

A billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.

# Meter Event Adjustment

A billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.

# Meter Event Summary

A billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.

# Plans

You can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the Prices API. It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.

Plans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. Products help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.

For example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.

# Test ClocksTest helper

A test clock enables deterministic control over objects in testmode. With a test clock, you can create objects at a frozen time in the past or future, and advance to a specific future time to observe webhooks and state changes. After the clock advances, you can either validate the current state of your scenario (and test your assumptions), change the current state of your scenario (and test more complex scenarios), or keep advancing forward in time.

# Accounts

This is an object representing a Stripe account. You can retrieve it to see properties on the account like its current requirements or if the account is enabled to make live charges or receive payouts.

For Custom accounts, the properties below are always returned. For other accounts, some properties are returned until that account has started to go through Connect Onboarding.

# Transfers

A Transfer object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.

Before April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a Payout object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the transfer/payout split.

# Transfer Reversals

Stripe Connect platforms can reverse transfers made to a connected account, either entirely or partially, and can also specify whether to refund any related application fees. Transfer reversals add to the platform’s balance and subtract from the destination account’s balance.

Reversing a transfer that was made for a destination charge is allowed only up to the amount of the charge. It is possible to reverse a transfer_group transfer only if the destination account has enough balance to cover the reversal.

# Secrets

Secret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.

The primary resource in Secret Store is a secret. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.

All Dashboard users and the app backend share account scoped secrets. Use the account scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.

A user scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the user scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.

Instructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment_method into the request.

Stripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.

You can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.

Forwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.
