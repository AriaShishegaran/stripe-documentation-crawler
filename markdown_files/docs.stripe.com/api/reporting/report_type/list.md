A VerificationSession guides you through the process of collecting and verifying the identities of your users. It contains details about the type of verification, such as what verification check to perform. Only create one VerificationSession for each verification in your system.

A VerificationSession transitions through multiple statuses throughout its lifetime as it progresses through the verification flow. The VerificationSession contains the user’s verified data after verification checks are complete.

# Verification Report

A VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the type and options parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: document, id_number, selfie.

Each VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the FileUpload API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the VerificationSession API.

# Forwarding RequestPreview feature

Instructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment_method into the request.

Stripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.

You can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.

Forwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.
