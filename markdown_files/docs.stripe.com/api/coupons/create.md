You can create coupons easily via the coupon management page of the Stripe dashboard. Coupon creation is also accessible via the API if you need to create coupons on the fly.

A coupon has either a percent_off or an amount_off and currency. If you set an amount_off, that amount will be subtracted from any invoice’s subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal of 100 EUR will have a final total of 0 EUR if a coupon with an amount_off of 20000 is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of 300 EUR will have a final total of 100 EUR if a coupon with an amount_off of 20000 is applied to it.

### Parameters

- amount_offintegerA positive integer representing the amount to subtract from an invoice total (required if percent_off is not passed).


- currencyenumThree-letter ISO code for the currency of the amount_off parameter (required if amount_off is passed).


- durationenumSpecifies how long the discount will be in effect if used on a subscription. Defaults to once.

Possible enum values`forever`Applies to all charges from a subscription with this coupon applied.

`once`Applies to the first charge from a subscription with this coupon applied.

`repeating`Applies to charges in the first duration_in_months months from a subscription with this coupon applied.


- duration_in_monthsintegerRequired only if duration is repeating, in which case it must be a positive integer that specifies the number of months the discount will be in effect.


- metadataobjectSet of key-value pairs that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to metadata.


- namestringName of the coupon displayed to customers on, for instance invoices, or receipts. By default the id is shown if name is not set.


- percent_offfloatA positive float larger than 0, and smaller or equal to 100, that represents the discount the coupon will apply (required if amount_off is not passed).
