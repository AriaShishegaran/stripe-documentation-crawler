## Get started

You don’t actually have to integrate Przelewy24 and other payment methods individually. If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant payment methods to display. Follow a quickstart for one of our hosted UIs:

- [Checkout](/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted checkout page.
- [Elements](/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI components.

After setting up your payment form, activate the payment methods you want using the Stripe Dashboard.

### Other payment products

The following Stripe products also support adding Przelewy24 from the Dashboard:

- [Invoicing](/invoicing/quickstart-guide)
- [Payment Links](/payment-links)

If your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to manually configure Przelewy24 as a payment.

## Disputed payments

The risk of fraud or unrecognized payments is low because the customer must authenticate the payment with their bank. As a result, you won’t have disputes that turn into chargebacks, with funds withdrawn from your Stripe account.

## Refunds

Payments made with Przelewy24 can only be submitted for refund within 180 days from the date of the original charge. After 180 days, it is no longer possible to refund the charge.
