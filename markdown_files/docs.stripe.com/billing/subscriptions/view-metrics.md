Use the Stripe Dashboard to view metrics about your recurring revenue.Use Stripe’s analytics and reports to keep track of subscription metrics, and to understand and manage your revenue. We provide the following subscription metrics:

MetricDescriptionMonthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)Tracks normalized monthly revenue from all active and past-due subscriptions. Read more about MRR on[Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/questions/calculating-monthly-recurring-revenue-(mrr)-in-billing).Active subscribersThe total count of your active and past-due subscribers (not including trials or subscribers on free plans). We count a subscriber with multiple subscriptions as one subscriber. We also provide a breakdown of active subscriber growth by the sub-components of new, reactivated, and churned subscribers. Read more about active subscribers on[Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/questions/understanding-active-subscribers).New subscribersThe total number of new, non-trial, paid subscribers. We don’t include free plans or existing subscribers who add additional subscriptions. Read more about new subscribers on[Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/questions/understanding-the-new-subscribers-metric).New trialsThe total number of new subscriptions that start with a free trial period. Read more about new trials on[Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/questions/impact-of-subscription-trial-periods-on-monthly-recurring-revenue-%28mrr%29-in-billing).Trial conversion rateMeasures your success at converting trials to active subscriptions during a rolling 30-day period. Your trial conversion rate is the percentage that’s converted to an active subscription with a paid invoice during the last 30 days of your trials. Read more about trial conversion rates on[Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/questions/calculating-trial-conversion-rate-in-billing).Subscriber churn rateMeasures the portion of your subscribers who left during a rolling 30-day period. Your churn rate is the percentage of subscribers that churn during the 30-day period, including all active subscribers at the start of the period and any new subscribers in the period. Read more about subscriber churn rates on[Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/questions/calculating-subscriber-churn-rate-in-billing#:~:text=Billing-,Subscriber%20Churn%20Rate,-The%20churn%20rate).Churned revenueThe total MRR lost during a period due to downgrades or churn. We count voluntary and involuntary churn due to lack of payment. Read more about churned revenue on[Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/questions/calculating-subscriber-churn-rate-in-billing#:~:text=numerator%20and%20denominator.-,Churned%20Revenue,-The%20churned%20revenue).Retention by cohortShows the subscriber retention rate for each month following the month that the customer first subscribed, called “the cohort.” If a customer unsubscribes, then resubscribes, they remain part of their original cohort. Read more about retention by cohort on[Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/questions/subscriber-cohorts-and-cohort-retention-in-billing).Average revenue per userYour average MRR per user. We calculate this by dividing your MRR by the total number of active subscribers. Read more about the average revenue per user on[Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/questions/calculating-average-revenue-per-user-in-billing).Subscriber lifetime valueAn estimate of the total revenue you can expect to collect from your average subscriber before they churn. Read more about subscriber lifetime value on[Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/questions/calculating-subscriber-lifetime-value-in-billing).Hover over the metric charts on the Billing page for more details. Use this information to understand the performance of your past and expected revenue streams.
