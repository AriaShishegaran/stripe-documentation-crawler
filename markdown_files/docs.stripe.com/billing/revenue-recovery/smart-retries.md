Automatically retry failed payments and reduce involuntary churn.Although payments can fail for a number of reasons, many of them are recoverable. You can automatically retry failed payments with Stripe, without writing code.

Configure the settings in the Retries tab of the Revenue recovery Dashboard.

Stripe doesn’t retry payments for:

- Unavailable payment methods
- Detached connected accounts (Connect only)

Stripe recommends using Smart Retries. You can also create a custom retry schedule.

## Smart Retries

### Bank debit methods

To avoid bank fees, Stripe ​doesn’t retry invoice payments that customers made with bank debit methods including: BECS direct debit, Bacs direct debit, or SEPA direct debit.

Using machine learning, Smart Retries chooses the best times to retry failed payment attempts to increase the chance of successfully paying an invoice. The machine learning system behind Smart Retries uses time-dependent, dynamic signals, such as:

- The number of different devices that have presented a given payment method in the lastNhours.
- The best time to pay (payments made for debit cards in certain countries might be slightly more successful at 12:01 AM in local time zones).

Based on a combination of these factors, Stripe intelligently assesses when to retry payments. We continuously learn from new purchaser behaviors and transactions, which provide for a more targeted approach over traditional rules-based payment retry logic.



Smart Retries reattempts the charge according to your specifications for the number of retries and the maximum duration. You can also use Recovery automations to create different retry policies for different customer segments.

You can override this behavior by disabling Smart Retries and defining your own custom retry rules. When you enable dunning, the next_payment_attempt attribute indicates when the next collection attempt will be.

## ACH Debit retries

Enable ACH Debit retries to have Stripe automatically retry failed ACH Debit payments caused by insufficient funds. Stripe retries the failed ACH Debit a maximum of two times over a 14 day period.

You can turn on retries for recurring subscription invoices, one-off invoices, or both types of invoice.

Before retrying, make sure you’ve obtained authorization from your customer to retry a debit on their bank account.
