Use prebuilt UI components to embed Issuing card management into your website.BetaIssuing embedded components are in private beta. Email issuing-embedded-components@stripe.com to request access.

Give your connected accounts access to Issuing card management functionality on your website by using Connect embedded components. Connect embedded components allow you to create complex integrations with Stripe products that require minimal coding and configuration out of the box.

Stripe offers two different components for Issuing card management:

- Issuing Card component
- Issuing Cards List component

Security tipThese components are for admin users of connected accounts, who can access sensitive card and cardholder data of the entire connected account. These components shouldn’t be used to render UI for individual cardholders in any circumstance.

## Quickstart

Issuing Connect embedded components requires access to Issuing and Connect.

To learn how embedded components work, see the Connect embedded components guide. The corresponding embedded components quickstart can help you set up your environment.

To embed Issuing card management into your website:

1. Follow the steps to[create a connected account with Issuing capabilities](/issuing/connect#create-connected-accounts-with-issuing-capabilities).
2. [Create a cardholder and cards](/issuing/connect/cardholders-and-cards)for that connected account.
3. [Create an AccountSession](/connect/connect-embedded-components/quickstart#server-endpoint)with`issuing_card: {enabled: true}`or`issuing_cards_list: {enabled: true}`.
4. [Add the issuing-card or issuing-cards-list component to the DOM](/connect/connect-embedded-components/quickstart#embedded-component).

[Issuing Card component](#issuing-card-component)The Issuing Card component allows an admin to view individual card details. From this view, they can activate, deactivate (freeze), or cancel cards. If you implement sensitive data display, they can also view card numbers (PANs) and CVVs or CVCs for virtual cards.

### Issuing Card configuration

This embedded component supports the following parameters:

HTML + JSReactMethodTypeDescription`setDefaultCard``string`Sets the Issuing[Card](/api/issuing/cards/object#issuing_card_object-id)ID to display upon initial load.`setCardSwitching``boolean`Sets whether or not to render the card dropdown selector. Sets to`true`by default.`setFetchEphemeralKey``Function`Sets the callback that fetches the ephemeral key for the card. See[sensitive data display](#sensitive-data-display).[Issuing Cards List component](#issuing-cards-list-component)The Issuing Cards List component allows an admin to view all the cards on a connected account. They can filter cards by cardholder, creation date, and card type.

When the admin clicks on a row in the table, they see a view of the selected card where they can activate, deactivate (freeze), or cancel the card. If you implement sensitive data display, they can also view card numbers (PANs) and CVC or CVVs for virtual cards.

### Issuing Cards List configuration

This embedded component supports the following parameters:

HTML + JSReactMethodTypeDescription`setFetchEphemeralKey``Function`Sets the callback that fetches the ephemeral key for the currently selected card. See[sensitive data display](#sensitive-data-display).[Sensitive data display](#sensitive-data-display)Issuing Connect embedded components integrate with Issuing Elements to provide a PCI-compliant way for you to allow your admins to view card numbers (PANs) and CVV or CVCs for virtual cards. The sensitive data renders inside Stripe-hosted iframes and never touches your servers.

The components can use an ephemeral key to securely retrieve card information from the Stripe API without publicly exposing your secret keys.

To enable this functionality you must:

1. Set up an ephemeral key exchange on your server.
2. Pass an asynchronous callback to the components.

Stripe generates a nonce from the Card ID in the Issuing Card or Issuing Cards List component when a card is selected or loaded. Stripe then calls your callback function which returns an ephemeral key, and then renders a Show numbers button if the ephemeral key is valid.

### Ephemeral key exchange

Your server-side endpoint needs to accept a Card ID and a nonce. It can then create an ephemeral key using Stripe.

Here’s how you might implement an ephemeral key creation endpoint in web application frameworks across various languages:

server.js[Node](#)`// This example sets up an endpoint using the Express framework.
// Watch this video to get started: https://youtu.be/rPR2aJ6XnAc

const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

const stripe = require('stripe')('sk_test_Gx4mWEgHtCMr4DYMUIqfIrsz');

app.post('/ephemeral-keys', async (request, response) => {
  const { card_id, nonce } = request.body;

  const ephemeralKey = await stripe.ephemeralKeys.create({
    nonce: nonce,
    issuing_card: card_id,
  }, {
    apiVersion: '2024-04-10',
    stripeAccount: '{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}',
  });

  response.json({
    ephemeralKeySecret: ephemeralKey.secret,
    nonce: nonce,
    issuingCard: card_id,
  });
});`### Asynchronous callback

You must define an asynchronous function that accepts a named argument with property issuingCard which is a Card ID and additionally, a nonce property. This function must return an Object with properties issuingCard, nonce, and ephemeralKeySecret which are retrieved from the endpoint you set up in the previous step.

Here’s how you might implement this callback:

[JavaScript](#)`const issuingCard = stripeConnectInstance.create('issuing-card');
const fetchEphemeralKey = async (fetchParams) =>  {
  const { issuingCard, nonce } = fetchParams;

  // This may vary greatly based on your implementation
  const response = await myServer.getEphemeralKey({issuingCard, nonce})

  return {
    issuingCard: response.issuingCard,
    nonce: response.nonce,
    ephemeralKeySecret: response.ephemeralKeySecret
  }
}

issuingCard.setFetchEphemeralKey(fetchEphemeralKey);
document.body.appendChild(issuingCard);`Was this page helpful?[Yes](#)[No](#)Need help?[Contact Support](https://support.stripe.com/).Check out our[product changelog](https://stripe.com/blog/changelog).Questions?[Contact Sales](https://stripe.com/contact/sales).Powered by[Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev)Sign up for developer updates:Sign upYou can unsubscribe at any time.
