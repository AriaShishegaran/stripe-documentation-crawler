Learn how to activate and manage your Stripe account.You can begin using your Stripe account in test mode as soon as you create it. In test mode, you can simulate using all of Stripe’s features without moving real money. After you activate your account, you can accept payments, create additional accounts, start a team, and set up a custom email domain.

Stripe generates an ID for your account. This ID is different from your account’s name and uniquely identifies your account. You can find your account ID in your Account and Profile settings.
