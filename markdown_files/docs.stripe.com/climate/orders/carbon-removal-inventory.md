Learn about available carbon removal inventory.## Available products

Products represent the carbon removal inventory available for purchase. All products come from offtake agreements with carbon removal suppliers in Frontier’s portfolio.

### Buy the portfolio

Avoiding the worst impacts of climate change requires a portfolio of technologies. By purchasing the Frontier offtake portfolio, you accelerate the development of a range of carbon removal technologies while simultaneously maximizing the likelihood that your tons are delivered by the expected delivery year.

The portfolio currently includes Charm, Heirloom, CarbonCapture, and Lithos. Frontier conducts diligence on carbon removal technologies to grow this portfolio as the industry evolves.

A 3% fee is charged when buying the portfolio.

ProductIDExpected delivery yearPrice per metric tonFrontier offtake portfolio`climsku_frontier_offtake_portfolio_2027`2027550 USDTo provide users with price certainty, we take on the underlying pricing risk. If the actual price per ton delivered is less than price per ton sold, we’ll use all excess funds to buy more carbon removal. If the actual price per ton delivered is greater than the price per ton sold—for example, if only the more expensive suppliers can deliver—the price doesn’t change for you and the losses are borne by us.

We aim to fulfill orders from a diverse set of suppliers within Frontier’s offtake portfolio. However, we won’t fractionalize deliveries in quantities less than 1 ton (for example, an order for 4 tons might include deliveries from up to 4 suppliers).

### Buy from individual suppliers

If you’re excited about a particular technology or want to align purchases with company-specific attributes (for example, geography), you can also purchase from individual suppliers.

A 5% fee is charged when ordering from these suppliers.

Our goal is to bring new buyers into the market, not to make money. We price the products as close to cost as possible.

Fees help cover our underlying costs of administering the carbon removal portfolio. Frontier receives these fees for services including, but not limited to, sourcing, performing diligence, negotiating offtake agreements with, monitoring the progress of, and reallocating demand between carbon removal suppliers.
