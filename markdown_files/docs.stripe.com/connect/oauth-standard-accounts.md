Use the OAuth connection flow to allow a Stripe user to connect to your platform.OAuth is not recommended for new Connect platforms. We recommend using Connect Onboarding for Standard accounts instead.

Starting in June 2021, Platforms using OAuth with read_write scope won’t be able to connect to Standard accounts that are controlled by another platform.

Extensions will not experience any changes to how OAuth behaves. Learn more about OAuth changes for platform-controlled Standard accounts.

## The OAuth connection flow

### Account types

Connect platforms can work with three different[account types](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/accounts).This content applies to Custom and Express accounts, and Standard accounts with[platform controls](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/platform-controls-for-standard-accounts)enabled.A user connects to your platform using the following OAuth connection flow:

1. From a page on your site, the user clicks a[link](#integrating-oauth)that redirects them to Stripe, passing along your platform’s`client_id`.
2. On Stripe’s website, the user provides the necessary information for[connecting](#connect-users)to your platform.
3. The user is[redirected](#redirected)to your site, along with an authorization code.
4. Your site then makes a request to Stripe’s[OAuth token endpoint](#token-request)to complete the connection and fetch the user’s account ID.

NoteAs a platform, remember that data you create for an account (for example, charges, customers, invoices, and so on) will be visible on their Stripe account. It also means that if they connect other platforms, those platforms can access this data too.

[Create the OAuth link](#integrating-oauth)### Creating a connected account without code

Use this guide to learn how to use code to create a connected account. If you’re not ready to integrate yet, you can start by creating a connected account through the dashboard.

To start your integration, go to your platform settings and:

- Enable onboarding accounts with OAuth in the OAuth settings.
- Copy your`client_id`, a unique identifier for your platform that is generated by Stripe.
- Set your`redirect_uri`, the URL which your user will be redirected to after connecting their account. You must specify all redirect URLs in your platform settings. If you do not include the`redirect_uri`parameter in your request, Stripe defaults to using the first address you have configured in your platform settings.

Stripe also provides a development client_id to help with testing.

With these two pieces of information in hand, you’re ready to create the OAuth link. We recommend showing a Connect with Stripe button that sends users to the authorize_url endpoint:

`https://connect.stripe.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=ca_FkyHCg7X8mlvCUdMDao4mMxagUfhIwXb&scope=read_write`The Stripe endpoint should receive at least these three parameters:

- `response_type`, with a value ofcode
- Your`client_id`
- `scope`, with a value ofread_write

The scope parameter dictates what your platform can do on behalf of the connected account, with read_only being the default.

To prevent CSRF attacks, add the state parameter, passing along a unique token as the value. We’ll include the state you gave us when we redirect the user back to your site. Your site should confirm the state parameter hasn’t been modified.

Here’s how the above URL can be presented to your user to begin the connection, along with our Connect with Stripe button:

[Connect with](https://connect.stripe.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=ca_FkyHCg7X8mlvCUdMDao4mMxagUfhIwXb&scope=read_write)### Customize onboarding with OAuth parameters

You can change the behavior of the onboarding flow by including additional URL parameters in your OAuth link. A complete list of available parameters is available in the OAuth reference.

[User creates or connects their account](#connect-users)After the user clicks the link on your site, they’ll be taken to Stripe’s website where they’ll be prompted to allow or deny the connection to your platform.

The process of creating a Stripe account is incorporated into our authorization flow. You don’t need to worry about whether or not your users already have accounts.

The user is logged in and can choose an account to connect to your platform directly.

![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/oauth-register.fa953a975b7eb6112dddf8faaff24f67.png)

The user needs to create an account.

[User is redirected back to your site](#redirected)After the user connects their existing or newly created account to your platform, they are redirected back to your site, to the URL established as your platform’s redirect_uri.

For successful connections, we’ll pass along in the URL:

- The`scope`granted
- The`state`value, if provided
- An authorization code. The authorization code is short-lived, and can be used only once, in the POST request described in the next step.

`https://connect.stripe.com/connect/default/oauth/test?scope=read_write&code={AUTHORIZATION_CODE}`If the authorization was denied by the user, they’ll still be redirected back to your site, but the URL includes an error instead of the authorization code:

`https://connect.stripe.com/connect/default/oauth/test?error=access_denied&error_description=The%20user%20denied%20your%20request`[Platform completes the account connection](#token-request)Include the provided authorization code in a POST request to Stripe’s token endpoint to complete the connection and fetch the user’s account ID:

Command Line[curl](#)`curl https://connect.stripe.com/oauth/token \
  -u sk_test_Gx4mWEgHtCMr4DYMUIqfIrsz: \
  -d "code"="ac_123456789" \
  -d "grant_type"="authorization_code"`Note that you’ll make the request with your live or test secret API key, depending on whether you want to get a live or test access token back.

Stripe returns a response that includes the account ID (stripe_user_id) for the user:

`{
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "scope": "read_write",
  "livemode": false,
  "stripe_user_id": "{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}",
}`If there was a problem, we instead return an error:

`{
  "error": "invalid_grant",
  "error_description": "Authorization code does not exist: {AUTHORIZATION_CODE}"
}`You’re done! The user is now connected to your platform. Store the stripe_user_id in your database; this is the Stripe account ID for the new account. You’ll use this value to authenticate as the connected account by passing it into requests in the Stripe-Account header.

In your application, you might want to consider using a dedicated OAuth client library to simplify these steps. To find an OAuth library for your language or framework, you can refer to the list of client libraries on the OAuth website.

The refresh_token can be used to generate test access tokens for a production client_id or to roll your access token. You should hold on to this value, too, as you’re only able to get it after this initial POST request.

NoteStore the received account ID! Platforms need this information to perform requests on the user’s behalf.

## Revoked and revoking access

An account.application.deauthorized event occurs when a user disconnects your platform from their account. By watching for this event via webhooks, you can perform any necessary cleanup on your servers.

To disconnect an account with access to the Stripe Dashboard from your platform, POST your client_id and the connected account’s ID to connect.stripe.com/oauth/deauthorize:

Command Line[curl](#)`curl https://connect.stripe.com/oauth/deauthorize \
  -u sk_test_Gx4mWEgHtCMr4DYMUIqfIrsz: \
  -d client_id="ca_FkyHCg7X8mlvCUdMDao4mMxagUfhIwXb" \
  -d stripe_user_id=acct_ON3nXtRQkhmUIQ`You can use the API on your user’s behalf to accept payments, set up recurring billing, fetch account data, and so on.
