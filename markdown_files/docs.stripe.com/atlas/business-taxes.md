## File US Income Tax

What information you need to prepare depends on whether you’re forming a C Corporation or LLC. Before working with an accountant and filing taxes, prepare as much of your company’s year-end financial data as possible. This is part of your bookkeeping responsibilities. You can use tools like Bench or Pilot to help you with this process.

C CorporationLLCBe sure to have the following information for your corporation (as of the last day of the fiscal year that you’re filing for):

- General business information: This includes your EIN.


- Company financials: You can learn about year-end financial reports in our guide  tax season. If you don’t have any revenue or expenses for the past fiscal year, you might still need to file taxes.


- Company ownership: Your corporation might have shares held by individual shareholders or business entities. Make sure the information reflects the current ownership.


- Additional information: If your company employs people, owns property, operates locally in the US, or operates abroad, you might have additional tax and reporting requirements. Some of the taxes you might want to ask about include:

  - Transfer pricing (if you’re based outside the US).
  - State taxes (if you have business activity in any US state).
  - Sales taxes.
  - Employment taxes.

## File taxes in Delaware

Your company’s tax and reporting obligations in Delaware depend on whether you’re forming a C Corporation or an LLC.

C CorporationLLCAll Delaware C Corporations are required to pay the Delaware franchise tax and to file an annual report, which you can pay online if you want to complete it yourself. Even companies with no revenue in the previous fiscal year should expect to pay some amount. If you want to hire a tax professional to complete this, you can work with one of our tax partners or a tax advisor of your own choosing.

### Delaware franchise tax

You have the option to recalculate your taxes due on the Delaware website. Follow the steps below. Delaware sends notices using a calculation method that results in large tax bills for companies with more than 5,000 shares. Most Atlas companies find they pay less tax when they use the Assumed Par Value Capital method instead of the default Authorized Shares method. You can read about these methods on Delaware’s website. If the franchise tax isn’t submitted by March 1, there is a 200 USD late fee and interest of 1.5% per month on the tax amount originally due.
