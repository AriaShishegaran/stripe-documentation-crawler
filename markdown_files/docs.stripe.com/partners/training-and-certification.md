Become a Stripe-certified architect or developer.### Stripe training

To learn more about the free training we offer, visit Stripe training and our live upcoming events page.

We offer two types of Stripe certifications that to partners: architect and developer. Partners can achieve associate or professional-level certifications for each type. Stripe certifications let partners gain Stripe expertise and leverage their knowledge with in-depth training. After completing the additional requirements, these certifications can also help you become a Stripe verified partner. Regardless of the partner track, all partners can complete certifications.

To become a verified services partner, partners need two certifications, one of which must be a professional-level certification (the other can be associate or professional-level).
